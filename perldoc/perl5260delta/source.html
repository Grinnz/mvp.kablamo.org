=head1 NAME

perl5260delta - what is new for perl v5.26.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the 5.24.0 release and the
5.26.0 release.

=head1 Notice

This release includes three updates with widespread effects:

=over 4

=item * C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; no longer in C&lt;@INC&gt;

For security reasons, the current directory (C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt;) is no longer included
by default at the end of the module search path (C&lt;@INC&gt;). This may have
widespread implications for the building, testing and installing of
modules, and for the execution of scripts.  See the section
L&lt;&lt; Removal of the current directory (C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt;) from C&lt;@INC&gt; &gt;&gt;
for the full details.

=item * C&lt;do&gt; may now warn

C&lt;do&gt; now gives a deprecation warning when it fails to load a file which
it would have loaded had C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; been in C&lt;@INC&gt;.

=item * In regular expression patterns, a literal left brace C&lt;&quot;{&quot;&gt;
should be escaped

See L&lt;/Unescaped literal C&lt;&quot;{&quot;&gt; characters in regular expression patterns are no longer permissible&gt;.

=back

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Lexical subroutines are no longer experimental

Using the C&lt;lexical_subs&gt; feature introduced in v5.18 no longer emits a warning.  Existing
code that disables the C&lt;experimental::lexical_subs&gt; warning category
that the feature previously used will continue to work.  The
C&lt;lexical_subs&gt; feature has no effect; all Perl code can use lexical
subroutines, regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.

=head2 Indented Here-documents

This adds a new modifier C&lt;&quot;~&quot;&gt; to here-docs that tells the parser
that it should look for C&lt;/^\s*$DELIM\n/&gt; as the closing delimiter.

These syntaxes are all supported:

    &lt;&lt;~EOF;
    &lt;&lt;~\EOF;
    &lt;&lt;~&#39;EOF&#39;;
    &lt;&lt;~&quot;EOF&quot;;
    &lt;&lt;~`EOF`;
    &lt;&lt;~ &#39;EOF&#39;;
    &lt;&lt;~ &quot;EOF&quot;;
    &lt;&lt;~ `EOF`;

The C&lt;&quot;~&quot;&gt; modifier will strip, from each line in the here-doc, the
same whitespace that appears before the delimiter.

Newlines will be copied as-is, and lines that don&#39;t include the
proper beginning whitespace will cause perl to croak.

For example:

    if (1) {
      print &lt;&lt;~EOF;
        Hello there
        EOF
    }

prints &quot;Hello there\n&quot; with no leading whitespace.

=head2 New regular expression modifier C&lt;/xx&gt;

Specifying two C&lt;&quot;x&quot;&gt; characters to modify a regular expression pattern
does everything that a single one does, but additionally TAB and SPACE
characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and
can be added to improve readability, like
S&lt;C&lt;/[ ^ A-Z d-f p-x ]/xx&gt;&gt;.  Details are at
L&lt;perlre/E&lt;sol&gt;x and E&lt;sol&gt;xx&gt;.

=head2 C&lt;@{^CAPTURE}&gt;, C&lt;%{^CAPTURE}&gt;, and C&lt;%{^CAPTURE_ALL}&gt;

C&lt;@{^CAPTURE}&gt; exposes the capture buffers of the last match as an
array.  So C&lt;$1&gt; is C&lt;${^CAPTURE}[0]&gt;.  This is a more efficient equivalent
to code like C&lt;substr($matched_string,$-[0],$+[0]-$-[0])&gt;, and you don&#39;t
have to keep track of the C&lt;$matched_string&gt; either.  This variable has no
single character equivalent.  Note that, like the other regex magic variables,
the contents of this variable is dynamic; if you wish to store it beyond
the lifetime of the match you must copy it to another array.

C&lt;%{^CAPTURE}&gt; is equivalent to C&lt;%+&gt; (I&lt;i.e.&gt;, named captures).  Other than
being more self-documenting there is no difference between the two forms.

C&lt;%{^CAPTURE_ALL}&gt; is equivalent to C&lt;%-&gt; (I&lt;i.e.&gt;, all named captures).
Other than being more self-documenting there is no difference between the
two forms.

=head2 Declaring a reference to a variable

As an experimental feature, Perl now allows the referencing operator to come
after L&lt;C&lt;my()&gt;|perlfunc/my&gt;, L&lt;C&lt;state()&gt;|perlfunc/state&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;our()&gt;|perlfunc/our&gt;, or L&lt;C&lt;local()&gt;|perlfunc/local&gt;.  This syntax must
be enabled with C&lt;use feature &#39;declared_refs&#39;&gt;.  It is experimental, and will
warn by default unless C&lt;no warnings &#39;experimental::refaliasing&#39;&gt; is in effect.
It is intended mainly for use in assignments to references.  For example:

    use experimental &#39;refaliasing&#39;, &#39;declared_refs&#39;;
    my \$a = \$b;

See L&lt;perlref/Assigning to References&gt; for more details.

=head2 Unicode 9.0 is now supported

A list of changes is at L&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/&gt;.
Modules that are shipped with core Perl but not maintained by p5p do not
necessarily support Unicode 9.0.  L&lt;Unicode::Normalize&gt; does work on 9.0.

=head2 Use of C&lt;\p{I&lt;script&gt;}&gt; uses the improved Script_Extensions property

Unicode 6.0 introduced an improved form of the Script (C&lt;sc&gt;) property, and
called it Script_Extensions (C&lt;scx&gt;).  Perl now uses this improved
version when a property is specified as just C&lt;\p{I&lt;script&gt;}&gt;.  This
should make programs more accurate when determining if a character is
used in a given script, but there is a slight chance of breakage for
programs that very specifically needed the old behavior.  The meaning of
compound forms, like C&lt;\p{sc=I&lt;script&gt;}&gt; are unchanged.  See
L&lt;perlunicode/Scripts&gt;.

=head2 Perl can now do default collation in UTF-8 locales on platforms
that support it

Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and sorting in
UTF-8 locales.  Perl now works with those.  For portability and full
control, L&lt;Unicode::Collate&gt; is still recommended, but now you may
not need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on
your application.  See
L&lt;perllocale/Category C&lt;LC_COLLATE&gt;: Collation: Text Comparisons and Sorting&gt;.

=head2 Better locale collation of strings containing embedded C&lt;NUL&gt;
characters

In locales that have multi-level character weights, C&lt;NUL&gt;s are now
ignored at the higher priority ones.  There are still some gotchas in
some strings, though.  See
L&lt;perllocale/Collation of strings containing embedded C&lt;NUL&gt; characters&gt;.

=head2 C&lt;CORE&gt; subroutines for hash and array functions callable via
reference

The hash and array functions in the C&lt;CORE&gt; namespace (C&lt;keys&gt;, C&lt;each&gt;,
C&lt;values&gt;, C&lt;push&gt;, C&lt;pop&gt;, C&lt;shift&gt;, C&lt;unshift&gt; and C&lt;splice&gt;) can now
be called with ampersand syntax (C&lt;&amp;CORE::keys(\%hash&gt;) and via reference
(C&lt;&lt; my $k = \&amp;CORE::keys; $k-E&lt;gt&gt;(\%hash) &gt;&gt;).  Previously they could only be
used when inlined.

=head2 New Hash Function For 64-bit Builds

We have switched to a hybrid hash function to better balance
performance for short and long keys.

For short keys, 16 bytes and under, we use an optimised variant of
One At A Time Hard, and for longer keys we use Siphash 1-3.  For very
long keys this is a big improvement in performance.  For shorter keys
there is a modest improvement.

=head1 Security

=head2 Removal of the current directory (C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt;) from C&lt;@INC&gt;

The perl binary includes a default set of paths in C&lt;@INC&gt;.  Historically
it has also included the current directory (C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt;) as the final entry,
unless run with taint mode enabled (C&lt;perl -T&gt;).  While convenient, this has
security implications: for example, where a script attempts to load an
optional module when its current directory is untrusted (such as F&lt;/tmp&gt;),
it could load and execute code from under that directory.

Starting with v5.26, C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; is always removed by default, not just under
tainting.  This has major implications for installing modules and executing
scripts.

The following new features have been added to help ameliorate these
issues.

=over

=item * F&lt;Configure -Udefault_inc_excludes_dot&gt;

There is a new F&lt;Configure&gt; option, C&lt;default_inc_excludes_dot&gt; (enabled
by default) which builds a perl executable without C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt;; unsetting this
option using C&lt;-U&gt; reverts perl to the old behaviour.  This may fix your
path issues but will reintroduce all the security concerns, so don&#39;t
build a perl executable like this unless you&#39;re I&lt;really&gt; confident that
such issues are not a concern in your environment.

=item * C&lt;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&gt;

There is a new environment variable recognised by the perl interpreter.
If this variable has the value 1 when the perl interpreter starts up,
then C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; will be automatically appended to C&lt;@INC&gt; (except under tainting).

This allows you restore the old perl interpreter behaviour on a
case-by-case basis.  But note that this is intended to be a temporary crutch,
and this feature will likely be removed in some future perl version.
It is currently set by the C&lt;cpan&gt; utility and C&lt;Test::Harness&gt; to
ease installation of CPAN modules which have not been updated to handle the
lack of dot.  Once again, don&#39;t use this unless you are sure that this
will not reintroduce any security concerns.

=item * A new deprecation warning issued by C&lt;do&gt;.

While it is well-known that C&lt;use&gt; and C&lt;require&gt; use C&lt;@INC&gt; to search
for the file to load, many people don&#39;t realise that C&lt;do &quot;file&quot;&gt; also
searches C&lt;@INC&gt; if the file is a relative path.  With the removal of C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt;,
a simple C&lt;do &quot;file.pl&quot;&gt; will fail to read in and execute C&lt;file.pl&gt; from
the current directory.  Since this is commonly expected behaviour, a new
deprecation warning is now issued whenever C&lt;do&gt; fails to load a file which
it otherwise would have found if a dot had been in C&lt;@INC&gt;.

=back

Here are some things script and module authors may need to do to make
their software work in the new regime.

=over

=item * Script authors

If the issue is within your own code (rather than within included
modules), then you have two main options.  Firstly, if you are confident
that your script will only be run within a trusted directory (under which
you expect to find trusted files and modules), then add C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; back into the
path; I&lt;e.g.&gt;:

    BEGIN {
        my $dir = &quot;/some/trusted/directory&quot;;
        chdir $dir or die &quot;Can&#39;t chdir to $dir: $!\n&quot;;
        # safe now
        push @INC, &#39;.&#39;;
    }

    use &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;; # may load /some/trusted/directory/Foo/Bar.pm
    do &quot;config.pl&quot;; # may load /some/trusted/directory/config.pl

On the other hand, if your script is intended to be run from within
untrusted directories (such as F&lt;/tmp&gt;), then your script suddenly failing
to load files may be indicative of a security issue.  You most likely want
to replace any relative paths with full paths; for example,

    do &quot;foo_config.pl&quot;

might become

    do &quot;$ENV{HOME}/foo_config.pl&quot;

If you are absolutely certain that you want your script to load and
execute a file from the current directory, then use a C&lt;./&gt; prefix; for
example:

    do &quot;./foo_config.pl&quot;

=item * Installing and using CPAN modules

If you install a CPAN module using an automatic tool like C&lt;cpan&gt;, then
this tool will itself set the C&lt;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&gt; environment variable
while building and testing the module, which may be sufficient to install
a distribution which hasn&#39;t been updated to be dot-aware.  If you want to
install such a module manually, then you&#39;ll need to replace the
traditional invocation:

    perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install

with something like

    (export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1; \
     perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install)

Note that this only helps build and install an unfixed module.  It&#39;s
possible for the tests to pass (since they were run under
C&lt;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1&gt;), but for the module itself to fail to perform
correctly in production.  In this case, you may have to temporarily modify
your script until a fixed version of the module is released.
For example:

    use Foo::Bar;
    {
        local @INC = (@INC, &#39;.&#39;);
        # assuming read_config() needs &#39;.&#39; in @INC
        $config = Foo::Bar-&gt;read_config();
    }

This is only rarely expected to be necessary.  Again, if doing this,
assess the resultant risks first.

=item * Module Authors

If you maintain a CPAN distribution, it may need updating to run in
a dotless environment.  Although C&lt;cpan&gt; and other such tools will
currently set the C&lt;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&gt; during module build, this is a
temporary workaround for the set of modules which rely on C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; being in
C&lt;@INC&gt; for installation and testing, and this may mask deeper issues.  It
could result in a module which passes tests and installs, but which
fails at run time.

During build, test, and install, it will normally be the case that any perl
processes will be executing directly within the root directory of the
untarred distribution, or a known subdirectory of that, such as F&lt;t/&gt;.  It
may well be that F&lt;Makefile.PL&gt; or F&lt;t/foo.t&gt; will attempt to include
local modules and configuration files using their direct relative
filenames, which will now fail.

However, as described above, automatic tools like F&lt;cpan&gt; will (for now)
set the C&lt;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&gt; environment variable, which introduces
dot during a build.

This makes it likely that your existing build and test code will work, but
this may mask issues with your code which only manifest when used after
install.  It is prudent to try and run your build process with that
variable explicitly disabled:

    (export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=0; \
     perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install)

This is more likely to show up any potential problems with your module&#39;s
build process, or even with the module itself.  Fixing such issues will
ensure both that your module can again be installed manually, and that
it will still build once the C&lt;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&gt; crutch goes away.

When fixing issues in tests due to the removal of dot from C&lt;@INC&gt;,
reinsertion of dot into C&lt;@INC&gt; should be performed with caution, for this
too may suppress real errors in your runtime code.  You are encouraged
wherever possible to apply the aforementioned approaches with explicit
absolute/relative paths, or to relocate your needed files into a
subdirectory and insert that subdirectory into C&lt;@INC&gt; instead.

If your runtime code has problems under the dotless C&lt;@INC&gt;, then the comments
above on how to fix for script authors will mostly apply here too.  Bear in
mind though that it is considered bad form for a module to globally add a dot to
C&lt;@INC&gt;, since it introduces both a security risk and hides issues of
accidentally requiring dot in C&lt;@INC&gt;, as explained above.

=back

=head2 Escaped colons and relative paths in PATH

On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the C&lt;PATH&gt; environment
variable as tainted when starting a new process.  Previously, it was
allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to
something like C&lt;/\:.&gt;.  The check has been fixed to treat C&lt;&quot;.&quot;&gt; as tainted
in that example.

=head2 New C&lt;-Di&gt; switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output

This is used for debugging of code within PerlIO to avoid recursive
calls.  Previously this output would be sent to the file specified
by the C&lt;PERLIO_DEBUG&gt; environment variable if perl wasn&#39;t running
setuid and the C&lt;-T&gt; or C&lt;-t&gt; switches hadn&#39;t been parsed yet.

If perl performed output at a point where it hadn&#39;t yet parsed its
switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file
named by C&lt;PERLIO_DEBUG&gt; even when the C&lt;-T&gt; switch had been supplied.

Perl now requires the C&lt;-Di&gt; switch to be present before it will produce
PerlIO debugging
output.  By default this is written to C&lt;stderr&gt;, but can optionally
be redirected to a file by setting the C&lt;PERLIO_DEBUG&gt; environment
variable.

If perl is running setuid or the C&lt;-T&gt; switch was supplied,
C&lt;PERLIO_DEBUG&gt; is ignored and the debugging output is sent to
C&lt;stderr&gt; as for any other C&lt;-D&gt; switch.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Unescaped literal C&lt;&quot;{&quot;&gt; characters in regular expression
patterns are no longer permissible

You have to now say something like C&lt;&quot;\{&quot;&gt; or C&lt;&quot;[{]&quot;&gt; to specify to
match a LEFT CURLY BRACKET; otherwise, it is a fatal pattern compilation
error.  This change will allow future extensions to the language.

These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
raised for some uses starting in v5.22.  Unfortunately, the code added
to raise the message was buggy and failed to warn in some cases where
it should have.  Therefore, enforcement of this ban for these cases is
deferred until Perl 5.30, but the code has been fixed to raise a
default-on deprecation message for them in the meantime.

Some uses of literal C&lt;&quot;{&quot;&gt; occur in contexts where we do not foresee
the meaning ever being anything but the literal, such as the very first
character in the pattern, or after a C&lt;&quot;|&quot;&gt; meaning alternation.  Thus

 qr/{fee|{fie/

matches either of the strings C&lt;{fee&gt; or C&lt;{fie&gt;.  To avoid forcing
unnecessary code changes, these uses do not need to be escaped, and no
warning is raised about them, and there are no current plans to change this.

But it is always correct to escape C&lt;&quot;{&quot;&gt;, and the simple rule to
remember is to always do so.

See L&lt;Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here|perldiag/Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here in regex; marked by S&lt;E&lt;lt&gt;-- HERE&gt; in mE&lt;sol&gt;%sE&lt;sol&gt;&gt;.

=head2 C&lt;scalar(%hash)&gt; return signature changed

The value returned for C&lt;scalar(%hash)&gt; will no longer show information about
the buckets allocated in the hash.  It will simply return the count of used
keys.  It is thus equivalent to C&lt;0+keys(%hash)&gt;.

A form of backward compatibility is provided via
L&lt;C&lt;Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()&gt;|Hash::Util/bucket_ratio&gt; which provides
the same behavior as
C&lt;scalar(%hash)&gt; provided in Perl 5.24 and earlier.

=head2 C&lt;keys&gt; returned from an lvalue subroutine

C&lt;keys&gt; returned from an lvalue subroutine can no longer be assigned
to in list context.

    sub foo : lvalue { keys(%INC) }
    (foo) = 3; # death
    sub bar : lvalue { keys(@_) }
    (bar) = 3; # also an error

This makes the lvalue sub case consistent with C&lt;(keys %hash) = ...&gt; and
C&lt;(keys @_) = ...&gt;, which are also errors.
L&lt;[perl #128187]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128187&gt;

=head2 The C&lt;${^ENCODING}&gt; facility has been removed

The special behaviour associated with assigning a value to this variable
has been removed.  As a consequence, the L&lt;encoding&gt; pragma&#39;s default mode
is no longer supported.  If
you still need to write your source code in encodings other than UTF-8, use a
source filter such as L&lt;Filter::Encoding&gt; on CPAN or L&lt;encoding&gt;&#39;s C&lt;Filter&gt;
option.

=head2 C&lt;POSIX::tmpnam()&gt; has been removed

The fundamentally unsafe C&lt;tmpnam()&gt; interface was deprecated in
Perl 5.22 and has now been removed.  In its place, you can use,
for example, the L&lt;File::Temp&gt; interfaces.

=head2 require ::Foo::Bar is now illegal.

Formerly, C&lt;require ::Foo::Bar&gt; would try to read F&lt;/Foo/Bar.pm&gt;.  Now any
bareword require which starts with a double colon dies instead.

=head2 Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
5.20.  This affects things like C&lt;$I&lt;\cT&gt;&gt;, where I&lt;\cT&gt; is a literal
control (such as a C&lt;NAK&gt; or C&lt;NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE&gt; character) in the
source code.

=head2 C&lt;NBSP&gt; is no longer permissible in C&lt;\N{...}&gt;

The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
has been deprecated to do so since Perl 5.22.

=head1 Deprecations

=head2 String delimiters that aren&#39;t stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated

For Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode
grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be
a sequence of several ones), we have to stop allowing a single character
delimiter that isn&#39;t a grapheme by itself.  These are unlikely to exist
in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the
character in front of them.

=head2 C&lt;\cI&lt;X&gt;&gt; that maps to a printable is no longer deprecated

This means we have no plans to remove this feature.  It still raises a
warning, but only if syntax warnings are enabled.  The feature was
originally intended to be a way to express non-printable characters that
don&#39;t have a mnemonic (C&lt;\t&gt; and C&lt;\n&gt; are mnemonics for two
non-printable characters, but most non-printables don&#39;t have a
mnemonic.)  But the feature can be used to specify a few printable
characters, though those are more clearly expressed as the printable
itself.  See
L&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2017/02/msg242944.html&gt;.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

A hash in boolean context is now sometimes faster, I&lt;e.g.&gt;

    if (!%h) { ... }

This was already special-cased, but some cases were missed (such as
C&lt;grep %$_, @AoH&gt;), and even the ones which weren&#39;t have been improved.

=item * New Faster Hash Function on 64 bit builds

We use a different hash function for short and long keys.  This should
improve performance and security, especially for long keys.

=item * readline is faster

Reading from a file line-by-line with C&lt;readline()&gt; or C&lt;&lt; E&lt;lt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt; &gt;&gt; should
now typically be faster due to a better implementation of the code that
searches for the next newline character.

=item *

Assigning one reference to another, I&lt;e.g.&gt; C&lt;$ref1 = $ref2&gt; has been
optimized in some cases.

=item *

Remove some exceptions to creating Copy-on-Write strings. The string
buffer growth algorithm has been slightly altered so that you&#39;re less
likely to encounter a string which can&#39;t be COWed.

=item *

Better optimise array and hash assignment: where an array or hash appears
in the LHS of a list assignment, such as C&lt;(..., @a) = (...);&gt;, it&#39;s
likely to be considerably faster, especially if it involves emptying the
array/hash. For example, this code runs about a third faster compared to
Perl 5.24.0:

    my @a;
    for my $i (1..10_000_000) {
        @a = (1,2,3);
        @a = ();
    }

=item *

Converting a single-digit string to a number is now substantially faster.

=item *

The C&lt;split&gt; builtin is now slightly faster in many cases: in particular
for the two specially-handled forms

    my    @a = split ...;
    local @a = split ...;

=item *

The rather slow implementation for the experimental subroutine signatures
feature has been made much faster; it is now comparable in speed with the
traditional C&lt;my ($a, $b, @c) = @_&gt;.

=item *

Bareword constant strings are now permitted to take part in constant
folding.  They were originally exempted from constant folding in August 1999,
during the development of Perl 5.6, to ensure that C&lt;use strict &quot;subs&quot;&gt;
would still apply to bareword constants.  That has now been accomplished a
different way, so barewords, like other constants, now gain the performance
benefits of constant folding.

This also means that void-context warnings on constant expressions of
barewords now report the folded constant operand, rather than the operation;
this matches the behaviour for non-bareword constants.

is always a metacharacter unless escaped.  Being a metacharacter only

having the pattern mean something quite different than was intended,

On systems that build a F&lt;dtrace&gt; object file (FreeBSD, Solaris, and

features.  Compatibility with Perl 5.8 was inadvertently removed some time

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.  Furthermore, these substantive changes were made:

=over 4

=item *

A new test script, F&lt;comp/parser_run.t&gt;, has been added that is like
F&lt;comp/parser.t&gt; but with F&lt;test.pl&gt; included so that C&lt;runperl()&gt; and the
like are available for use.

=item *

Tests for locales were erroneously using locales incompatible with Perl.

=item *

Some parts of the test suite that try to exhaustively test edge cases in the
regex implementation have been restricted to running for a maximum of five
minutes.  On slow systems they could otherwise take several hours, without
significantly improving our understanding of the correctness of the code
under test.

=item *

A new internal facility allows analysing the time taken by the individual
tests in Perl&#39;s own test suite; see F&lt;Porting/harness-timer-report.pl&gt;.

=item *

F&lt;t/re/regexp_nonull.t&gt; has been added to test that the regular expression
engine can handle scalars that do not have a null byte just past the end of
the string.

=item *

A new test script, F&lt;t/op/decl-refs.t&gt;, has been added to test the new feature
L&lt;/Declaring a reference to a variable&gt;.

=item *

A new test script, F&lt;t/re/keep_tabs.t&gt; has been added to contain tests
where C&lt;\t&gt; characters should not be expanded into spaces.

=item *

A new test script, F&lt;t/re/anyof.t&gt;, has been added to test that the ANYOF nodes
generated by bracketed character classes are as expected.

=item *

There is now more extensive testing of the Unicode-related API macros
and functions.

=item *

Several of the longer running API test files have been split into
multiple test files so that they can be run in parallel.

Perl now compiles under NetBSD on VAX machines.  However, it&#39;s not
possible for that platform to implement floating-point infinities and
NaNs compatible with most modern systems, which implement the IEEE-754
floating point standard.  The hexadecimal floating point (C&lt;0x...p[+-]n&gt;
literals, C&lt;printf %a&gt;) is not implemented, either.
The C&lt;make test&gt; passes 98% of tests.

The path separator for the C&lt;PERL5LIB&gt; and C&lt;PERLLIB&gt; environment entries is

running under DCL (it&#39;s still C&lt;&quot;|&quot;&gt;).

=item *

F&lt;configure.com&gt; now recognizes the VSI-branded C compiler and no longer
recognizes the &quot;DEC&quot;-branded C compiler (as there hasn&#39;t been such a thing for
15 or more years).

=back

=item Windows

=over 4

=item *

Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
(containing Visual C++ 14.0) has been added.

This version of VC++ includes a completely rewritten C run-time library, some
of the changes in which mean that work done to resolve a socket
C&lt;close()&gt; bug in
perl #120091 and perl #118059 is not workable in its current state with this
version of VC++.  Therefore, we have effectively reverted that bug fix for
VS2015 onwards on the basis that being able to build with VS2015 onwards is
more important than keeping the bug fix.  We may revisit this in the future to
attempt to fix the bug again in a way that is compatible with VS2015.

These changes do not affect compilation with GCC or with Visual Studio versions
up to and including VS2013, I&lt;i.e.&gt;, the bug fix is retained (unchanged) for those
compilers.

Note that you may experience compatibility problems if you mix a perl built
with GCC or VS E&lt;lt&gt;= VS2013 with XS modules built with VS2015, or if you mix a
perl built with VS2015 with XS modules built with GCC or VS E&lt;lt&gt;= VS2013.
Some incompatibility may arise because of the bug fix that has been reverted
for VS2015 builds of perl, but there may well be incompatibility anyway because
of the rewritten CRT in VS2015 (I&lt;e.g.&gt;, see discussion at
L&lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30412951&gt;).

=item *

It now automatically detects GCC versus Visual C and sets the VC version
number on Win32.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

A new API function L&lt;C&lt;sv_setpv_bufsize()&gt;|perlapi/sv_setpv_bufsize&gt;
allows simultaneously setting the
length and the allocated size of the buffer in an C&lt;SV&gt;, growing the
buffer if necessary.

=item *

A new API macro L&lt;C&lt;SvPVCLEAR()&gt;|perlapi/SvPVCLEAR&gt; sets its C&lt;SV&gt;
argument to an empty string,
like Perl-space C&lt;$x = &#39;&#39;&gt;, but with several optimisations.

=item *

Several new macros and functions for dealing with Unicode and
UTF-8-encoded strings have been added to the API, as well as some
changes in the
functionality of existing functions (see L&lt;perlapi/Unicode Support&gt; for
more details):

=over

=item *

New versions of the API macros like C&lt;isALPHA_utf8&gt; and C&lt;toLOWER_utf8&gt;
have been added, each with the suffix C&lt;_safe&gt;, like
L&lt;C&lt;isSPACE_utf8_safe&gt;|perlapi/isSPACE&gt;.  These take an extra
parameter, giving an upper
limit of how far into the string it is safe to read.  Using the old
versions could cause attempts to read beyond the end of the input buffer
if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and their use now raises a deprecation
warning.  Details are at L&lt;perlapi/Character classification&gt;.

=item *

Macros like L&lt;C&lt;isALPHA_utf8&gt;|perlapi/isALPHA&gt; and
L&lt;C&lt;toLOWER_utf8&gt;|perlapi/toLOWER_utf8&gt; now die if they detect
that their input UTF-8 is malformed.  A deprecation warning had been
issued since Perl 5.18.

=item *

Several new macros for analysing the validity of utf8 sequences. These
are:

L&lt;C&lt;UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt;|perlapi/UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt;
L&lt;C&lt;UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION&gt;|perlapi/UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION&gt;

L&lt;C&lt;isC9_STRICT_UTF8_CHAR&gt;|perlapi/isC9_STRICT_UTF8_CHAR&gt;

=item *

Functions that are all extensions of the C&lt;is_utf8_string_I&lt;*&gt;()&gt; functions,
that apply various restrictions to the UTF-8 recognized as valid:

L&lt;C&lt;is_strict_utf8_string&gt;|perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_strict_utf8_string_loc&gt;|perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string_loc&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_strict_utf8_string_loclen&gt;|perlapi/is_strict_utf8_string_loclen&gt;,

L&lt;C&lt;is_c9strict_utf8_string&gt;|perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_c9strict_utf8_string_loc&gt;|perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string_loc&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_c9strict_utf8_string_loclen&gt;|perlapi/is_c9strict_utf8_string_loclen&gt;,

L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_string_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_string_flags&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_string_loc_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_string_loc_flags&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_string_loclen_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_string_loclen_flags&gt;,

L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_flags&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loc_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loc_flags&gt;,
L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loclen_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_fixed_width_buf_loclen_flags&gt;.

L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_invariant_string&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_invariant_string&gt;.
L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_valid_partial_char&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_valid_partial_char&gt;.
L&lt;C&lt;is_utf8_valid_partial_char_flags&gt;|perlapi/is_utf8_valid_partial_char_flags&gt;.

=item *

The functions L&lt;C&lt;utf8n_to_uvchr&gt;|perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr&gt; and its
derivatives have had several changes of behaviour.

Calling them, while passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against
in DEBUGGING builds, and otherwise, returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER.   If you have nothing to decode, you shouldn&#39;t call the decode
function.

They now return the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called with UTF-8
that has the overlong malformation and that malformation is allowed by
the input parameters.  This malformation is where the UTF-8 looks valid
syntactically, but there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code
point.  This has been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.

They now accept an input
flag to allow the overflow malformation.  This malformation is when the
UTF-8 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is
not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform.
What &quot;allowed&quot; means, in this case, is that the function doesn&#39;t return an
error, and it advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in
question, but it returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value
of the code point (since the real value is not representable).

They no longer abandon searching for other malformations when the first
one is encountered.  A call to one of these functions thus can generate
multiple diagnostics, instead of just one.

=item *

L&lt;C&lt;valid_utf8_to_uvchr()&gt;|perlapi/valid_utf8_to_uvchr&gt; has been added
to the API (although it was
present in core earlier). Like C&lt;utf8_to_uvchr_buf()&gt;, but assumes that
the next character is well-formed.  Use with caution.

=item *

A new function, L&lt;C&lt;utf8n_to_uvchr_error&gt;|perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr_error&gt;,
has been added for
use by modules that need to know the details of UTF-8 malformations
beyond pass/fail.  Previously, the only ways to know why a sequence was
ill-formed was to capture and parse the generated diagnostics or to do
your own analysis.

=item *

There is now a safer version of utf8_hop(), called
L&lt;C&lt;utf8_hop_safe()&gt;|perlapi/utf8_hop_safe&gt;.
Unlike utf8_hop(), utf8_hop_safe() won&#39;t navigate before the beginning or
after the end of the supplied buffer.

=item *

Two new functions, L&lt;C&lt;utf8_hop_forward()&gt;|perlapi/utf8_hop_forward&gt; and
L&lt;C&lt;utf8_hop_back()&gt;|perlapi/utf8_hop_back&gt; are
similar to C&lt;utf8_hop_safe()&gt; but are for when you know which direction
you wish to travel.

=item *

Two new macros which return useful utf8 byte sequences:

L&lt;C&lt;BOM_UTF8&gt;|perlapi/BOM_UTF8&gt;

L&lt;C&lt;REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER_UTF8&gt;|perlapi/REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER_UTF8&gt;

=back

=item *

Perl is now built with the C&lt;PERL_OP_PARENT&gt; compiler define enabled by
default.  To disable it, use the C&lt;PERL_NO_OP_PARENT&gt; compiler define.
This flag alters how the C&lt;op_sibling&gt; field is used in C&lt;OP&gt; structures,
and has been available optionally since perl 5.22.

See L&lt;perl5220delta/&quot;Internal Changes&quot;&gt; for more details of what this
build option does.

=item *

Three new ops, C&lt;OP_ARGELEM&gt;, C&lt;OP_ARGDEFELEM&gt;, and C&lt;OP_ARGCHECK&gt; have
been added.  These are intended principally to implement the individual
elements of a subroutine signature, plus any overall checking required.

=item *

The C&lt;OP_PUSHRE&gt; op has been eliminated and the C&lt;OP_SPLIT&gt; op has been
changed from class C&lt;LISTOP&gt; to C&lt;PMOP&gt;.

Formerly the first child of a split would be a C&lt;pushre&gt;, which would have the
C&lt;split&gt;&#39;s regex attached to it. Now the regex is attached directly to the
C&lt;split&gt; op, and the C&lt;pushre&gt; has been eliminated.

=item *

The L&lt;C&lt;op_class()&gt;|perlapi/op_class&gt; API function has been added.  This
is like the existing
C&lt;OP_CLASS()&gt; macro, but can more accurately determine what struct an op
has been allocated as.  For example C&lt;OP_CLASS()&gt; might return
C&lt;OA_BASEOP_OR_UNOP&gt; indicating that ops of this type are usually
allocated as an C&lt;OP&gt; or C&lt;UNOP&gt;; while C&lt;op_class()&gt; will return
C&lt;OPclass_BASEOP&gt; or C&lt;OPclass_UNOP&gt; as appropriate.

=item *

All parts of the internals now agree that the C&lt;sassign&gt; op is a C&lt;BINOP&gt;;
previously it was listed as a C&lt;BASEOP&gt; in F&lt;regen/opcodes&gt;, which meant
that several parts of the internals had to be special-cased to accommodate
it.  This oddity&#39;s original motivation was to handle code like C&lt;$x ||= 1&gt;;
that is now handled in a simpler way.

=item *

The output format of the L&lt;C&lt;op_dump()&gt;|perlapi/op_dump&gt; function (as
used by C&lt;perl -Dx&gt;)
has changed: it now displays an &quot;ASCII-art&quot; tree structure, and shows more
low-level details about each op, such as its address and class.

=item *

The C&lt;PADOFFSET&gt; type has changed from being unsigned to signed, and
several pad-related variables such as C&lt;PL_padix&gt; have changed from being
of type C&lt;I32&gt; to type C&lt;PADOFFSET&gt;.

=item *

The C&lt;DEBUGGING&gt;-mode output for regex compilation and execution has been
enhanced.

=item *

Several obscure SV flags have been eliminated, sometimes along with the
macros which manipulate them: C&lt;SVpbm_VALID&gt;, C&lt;SVpbm_TAIL&gt;, C&lt;SvTAIL_on&gt;,
C&lt;SvTAIL_off&gt;, C&lt;SVrepl_EVAL&gt;, C&lt;SvEVALED&gt;.

=item *

An OP C&lt;op_private&gt; flag has been eliminated: C&lt;OPpRUNTIME&gt;. This used to
often get set on C&lt;PMOP&gt; ops, but had become meaningless over time.

The C&lt;&amp;.&gt; operator (and the C&lt;&quot;&amp;&quot;&gt; operator, when it treats its arguments as

Problems with in-place array sorts: code like C&lt;@a = sort { ... } @a&gt;,
where the source and destination of the sort are the same plain array, are
optimised to do less copying around.  Two side-effects of this optimisation
were that the contents of C&lt;@a&gt; as seen by sort routines were
partially sorted; and under some circumstances accessing C&lt;@a&gt; during the
sort could crash the interpreter.  Both these issues have been fixed, and

The use of built-in arrays or hash slices in a double-quoted string no

List assignment in list context where the LHS contained aggregates and

Previously, C&lt;(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (1))&gt; in list context returned C&lt;($a)&gt;; now
it returns C&lt;($a,$b,$d)&gt;.  C&lt;(($a,$b,$c) = (1))&gt; is unchanged: it still

    sub inc { $_++ for @_ }
    inc(($a,$b,@c,$d) = (10))

Formerly, the values of C&lt;($a,$b,$d)&gt; would be left as C&lt;(11,undef,undef)&gt;;

G++ 6 handles subnormal (denormal) floating point values differently
than gcc 6 or g++ 5 resulting in &quot;flush-to-zero&quot;. The end result is
that if you specify very small values using the hexadecimal floating
point format, like C&lt;0x1.fffffffffffffp-1022&gt;, they become zeros.

=head1 Obituary

Jon Portnoy (AVENJ), a prolific Perl author and admired Gentoo community
member, has passed away on August 10, 2016.  He will be remembered and
missed by all those who he came in contact with, and enriched with his
intellect, wit, and spirit.

It is with great sadness that we also note Kip Hampton&#39;s passing.  Probably
best known as the author of the Perl &amp; XML column on XML.com, he was a
core contributor to AxKit, an XML server platform that became an Apache
Foundation project.  He was a frequent speaker in the early days at
OSCON, and most recently at YAPC::NA in Madison.  He was frequently on
irc.perl.org as ubu, generally in the #axkit-dahut community, the
group responsible for YAPC::NA Asheville in 2011.

Kip and his constant contributions to the community will be greatly
missed.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl&#39;s core.  We&#39;re grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

For a more complete list of all of Perl&#39;s historical contributors, please see
the F&lt;AUTHORS&gt; file in the Perl source distribution.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at
L&lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt;.  There may also be information at
L&lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L&lt;perlbug&gt; program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C&lt;perl -V&gt;,
will be sent off to C&lt;perlbug@perl.org&gt; to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L&lt;perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&gt;
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C&lt;perlthanks&gt; program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
