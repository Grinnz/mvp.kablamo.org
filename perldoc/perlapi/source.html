=head1 NAME

perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X&lt;Perl API&gt; X&lt;API&gt; X&lt;api&gt;

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by
F&lt;embed.pl&gt;, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables
that may be used by extension writers.  L&lt;At the end|/Undocumented functions&gt;
is a list of functions which have yet to be documented.  The interfaces of
those are subject to change without notice.  Anything not listed here is
not part of the public API, and should not be used by extension writers at
all.  For these reasons, blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be
avoided when writing extensions.

In Perl, unlike C, a string of characters may generally contain embedded
C&lt;NUL&gt; characters.  Sometimes in the documentation a Perl string is referred
to as a &quot;buffer&quot; to distinguish it from a C string, but sometimes they are
both just referred to as strings.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C&lt;PL_&gt;
prefix.  Again, those not listed here are not to be used by extension writers,
and can be changed or removed without notice; same with macros.
Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).
And documentation and comments may still use the term ASCII, when
sometimes in fact the entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.

The non-ASCII characters below 256 can have various meanings, depending on
various things.  (See, most notably, L&lt;perllocale&gt;.)  But usually the whole
range can be referred to as ISO-8859-1.  Often, the term &quot;Latin-1&quot; (or
&quot;Latin1&quot;) is used as an equivalent for ISO-8859-1.  But some people treat
&quot;Latin1&quot; as referring just to the characters in the range 128 through 255, or
somethimes from 160 through 255.
This documentation uses &quot;Latin1&quot; and &quot;Latin-1&quot; to refer to all 256 characters.

Note that Perl can be compiled and run under either ASCII or EBCDIC (See
L&lt;perlebcdic&gt;).  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the code)
ignore the EBCDIC possibility.  
For almost all purposes the differences are transparent.
As an example, under EBCDIC,
instead of UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so
whenever this documentation refers to C&lt;utf8&gt;
(and variants of that name, including in function names),
it also (essentially transparently) means C&lt;UTF-EBCDIC&gt;.
But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII, EBCDIC, and
the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may occupy a different
number of bytes than in UTF-8.

The listing below is alphabetical, case insensitive.


=head1 Array Manipulation Functions

=over 8

=item av_clear
X&lt;av_clear&gt;

Frees the all the elements of an array, leaving it empty.
The XS equivalent of C&lt;@array = ()&gt;.  See also L&lt;/av_undef&gt;.

Note that it is possible that the actions of a destructor called directly
or indirectly by freeing an element of the array could cause the reference
count of the array itself to be reduced (e.g. by deleting an entry in the
symbol table). So it is a possibility that the AV could have been freed
(or even reallocated) on return from the call unless you hold a reference
to it.

	void	av_clear(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_create_and_push
X&lt;av_create_and_push&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Push an SV onto the end of the array, creating the array if necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

	void	av_create_and_push(AV **const avp,
		                   SV *const val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_create_and_unshift_one
X&lt;av_create_and_unshift_one&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Unshifts an SV onto the beginning of the array, creating the array if
necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

	SV**	av_create_and_unshift_one(AV **const avp,
		                          SV *const val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_delete
X&lt;av_delete&gt;

Deletes the element indexed by C&lt;key&gt; from the array, makes the element
mortal, and returns it.  If C&lt;flags&gt; equals C&lt;G_DISCARD&gt;, the element is
freed and NULL is returned. NULL is also returned if C&lt;key&gt; is out of
range.

Perl equivalent: S&lt;C&lt;splice(@myarray, $key, 1, undef)&gt;&gt; (with the
C&lt;splice&gt; in void context if C&lt;G_DISCARD&gt; is present).

	SV*	av_delete(AV *av, SSize_t key, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_exists
X&lt;av_exists&gt;

Returns true if the element indexed by C&lt;key&gt; has been initialized.

This relies on the fact that uninitialized array elements are set to
C&lt;NULL&gt;.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;exists($myarray[$key])&gt;.

	bool	av_exists(AV *av, SSize_t key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_extend
X&lt;av_extend&gt;

Pre-extend an array.  The C&lt;key&gt; is the index to which the array should be
extended.

	void	av_extend(AV *av, SSize_t key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_fetch
X&lt;av_fetch&gt;

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C&lt;key&gt; is the
index.  If lval is true, you are guaranteed to get a real SV back (in case
it wasn&#39;t real before), which you can then modify.  Check that the return
value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C&lt;SV*&gt;.

See L&lt;perlguts/&quot;Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays&quot;&gt; for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays. 

The rough perl equivalent is C&lt;$myarray[$key]&gt;.

	SV**	av_fetch(AV *av, SSize_t key, I32 lval)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item AvFILL
X&lt;AvFILL&gt;

Same as C&lt;av_top_index()&gt;.  Deprecated, use C&lt;av_top_index()&gt; instead.

	int	AvFILL(AV* av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item av_fill
X&lt;av_fill&gt;

Set the highest index in the array to the given number, equivalent to
Perl&#39;s S&lt;C&lt;$#array = $fill;&gt;&gt;.

The number of elements in the array will be S&lt;C&lt;fill + 1&gt;&gt; after
C&lt;av_fill()&gt; returns.  If the array was previously shorter, then the
additional elements appended are set to NULL.  If the array
was longer, then the excess elements are freed.  S&lt;C&lt;av_fill(av, -1)&gt;&gt; is
the same as C&lt;av_clear(av)&gt;.

	void	av_fill(AV *av, SSize_t fill)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_len
X&lt;av_len&gt;

Same as L&lt;/av_top_index&gt;.  Note that, unlike what the name implies, it returns
the highest index in the array, so to get the size of the array you need to use
S&lt;C&lt;av_len(av) + 1&gt;&gt;.  This is unlike L&lt;/sv_len&gt;, which returns what you would
expect.

	SSize_t	av_len(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_make
X&lt;av_make&gt;

Creates a new AV and populates it with a list of SVs.  The SVs are copied
into the array, so they may be freed after the call to C&lt;av_make&gt;.  The new AV
will have a reference count of 1.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;my @new_array = ($scalar1, $scalar2, $scalar3...);&gt;

	AV*	av_make(SSize_t size, SV **strp)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_pop
X&lt;av_pop&gt;

Removes one SV from the end of the array, reducing its size by one and
returning the SV (transferring control of one reference count) to the
caller.  Returns C&lt;&amp;PL_sv_undef&gt; if the array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;pop(@myarray);&gt;

	SV*	av_pop(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_push
X&lt;av_push&gt;

Pushes an SV (transferring control of one reference count) onto the end of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;push @myarray, $val;&gt;.

	void	av_push(AV *av, SV *val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_shift
X&lt;av_shift&gt;

Removes one SV from the start of the array, reducing its size by one and
returning the SV (transferring control of one reference count) to the
caller.  Returns C&lt;&amp;PL_sv_undef&gt; if the array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;shift(@myarray);&gt;

	SV*	av_shift(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_store
X&lt;av_store&gt;

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C&lt;key&gt;.  The
return value will be C&lt;NULL&gt; if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays).  Otherwise, it can be dereferenced
to get the C&lt;SV*&gt; that was stored
there (= C&lt;val&gt;)).

Note that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C&lt;val&gt; before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned C&lt;NULL&gt;.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C&lt;splice(@myarray, $key, 1, $val)&gt;.

See L&lt;perlguts/&quot;Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays&quot;&gt; for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

	SV**	av_store(AV *av, SSize_t key, SV *val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_tindex
X&lt;av_tindex&gt;

Same as C&lt;av_top_index()&gt;.

	int	av_tindex(AV* av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item av_top_index
X&lt;av_top_index&gt;

Returns the highest index in the array.  The number of elements in the
array is S&lt;C&lt;av_top_index(av) + 1&gt;&gt;.  Returns -1 if the array is empty.

The Perl equivalent for this is C&lt;$#myarray&gt;.

(A slightly shorter form is C&lt;av_tindex&gt;.)

	SSize_t	av_top_index(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_undef
X&lt;av_undef&gt;

Undefines the array. The XS equivalent of C&lt;undef(@array)&gt;.

As well as freeing all the elements of the array (like C&lt;av_clear()&gt;), this
also frees the memory used by the av to store its list of scalars.

See L&lt;/av_clear&gt; for a note about the array possibly being invalid on
return.

	void	av_undef(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_unshift
X&lt;av_unshift&gt;

Unshift the given number of C&lt;undef&gt; values onto the beginning of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.

Perl equivalent: S&lt;C&lt;unshift @myarray, ((undef) x $num);&gt;&gt;

	void	av_unshift(AV *av, SSize_t num)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item get_av
X&lt;get_av&gt;

Returns the AV of the specified Perl global or package array with the given
name (so it won&#39;t work on lexical variables).  C&lt;flags&gt; are passed 
to C&lt;gv_fetchpv&gt;.  If C&lt;GV_ADD&gt; is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C&lt;flags&gt; is zero
and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;@{&quot;$name&quot;}&gt;.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	AV*	get_av(const char *name, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item newAV
X&lt;newAV&gt;

Creates a new AV.  The reference count is set to 1.

Perl equivalent: C&lt;my @array;&gt;.

	AV*	newAV()

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item sortsv
X&lt;sortsv&gt;

In-place sort an array of SV pointers with the given comparison routine.

Currently this always uses mergesort.  See C&lt;L&lt;/sortsv_flags&gt;&gt; for a more
flexible routine.

	void	sortsv(SV** array, size_t num_elts,
		       SVCOMPARE_t cmp)

=for hackers
Found in file pp_sort.c

=item sortsv_flags
X&lt;sortsv_flags&gt;

In-place sort an array of SV pointers with the given comparison routine,
with various SORTf_* flag options.

	void	sortsv_flags(SV** array, size_t num_elts,
		             SVCOMPARE_t cmp, U32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file pp_sort.c

=head1 Callback Functions

=over 8

=item call_argv
X&lt;call_argv&gt;

Performs a callback to the specified named and package-scoped Perl subroutine 
with C&lt;argv&gt; (a C&lt;NULL&gt;-terminated array of strings) as arguments.  See
L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C&lt;&amp;{&quot;$sub_name&quot;}(@$argv)&gt;.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_argv(const char* sub_name, I32 flags,
		          char** argv)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item call_method
X&lt;call_method&gt;

Performs a callback to the specified Perl method.  The blessed object must
be on the stack.  See L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_method(const char* methname, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item call_pv
X&lt;call_pv&gt;

Performs a callback to the specified Perl sub.  See L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_pv(const char* sub_name, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item call_sv
X&lt;call_sv&gt;

Performs a callback to the Perl sub specified by the SV.

If neither the C&lt;G_METHOD&gt; nor C&lt;G_METHOD_NAMED&gt; flag is supplied, the
SV may be any of a CV, a GV, a reference to a CV, a reference to a GV
or C&lt;SvPV(sv)&gt; will be used as the name of the sub to call.

If the C&lt;G_METHOD&gt; flag is supplied, the SV may be a reference to a CV or
C&lt;SvPV(sv)&gt; will be used as the name of the method to call.

If the C&lt;G_METHOD_NAMED&gt; flag is supplied, C&lt;SvPV(sv)&gt; will be used as
the name of the method to call.

Some other values are treated specially for internal use and should
not be depended on.

See L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_sv(SV* sv, VOL I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item ENTER
X&lt;ENTER&gt;

Opening bracket on a callback.  See C&lt;L&lt;/LEAVE&gt;&gt; and L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

		ENTER;

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item ENTER_with_name(name)
X&lt;ENTER_with_name(name)&gt;

Same as C&lt;L&lt;/ENTER&gt;&gt;, but when debugging is enabled it also associates the
given literal string with the new scope.

		ENTER_with_name(name);

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item eval_pv
X&lt;eval_pv&gt;

Tells Perl to C&lt;eval&gt; the given string in scalar context and return an SV* result.

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item eval_sv
X&lt;eval_sv&gt;

Tells Perl to C&lt;eval&gt; the string in the SV.  It supports the same flags
as C&lt;call_sv&gt;, with the obvious exception of C&lt;G_EVAL&gt;.  See L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	eval_sv(SV* sv, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item FREETMPS
X&lt;FREETMPS&gt;

Closing bracket for temporaries on a callback.  See C&lt;L&lt;/SAVETMPS&gt;&gt; and
L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

		FREETMPS;

X&lt;LEAVE&gt;

Closing bracket on a callback.  See C&lt;L&lt;/ENTER&gt;&gt; and L&lt;perlcall&gt;.

		LEAVE;

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item LEAVE_with_name(name)
X&lt;LEAVE_with_name(name)&gt;

Same as C&lt;L&lt;/LEAVE&gt;&gt;, but when debugging is enabled it first checks that the
scope has the given name. C&lt;name&gt; must be a C&lt;NUL&gt;-terminated literal string.

		LEAVE_with_name(name);

=for hackers
Found in file scope.h

=item SAVETMPS
X&lt;SAVETMPS&gt;

=head1 Character case changing

Perl uses &quot;full&quot; Unicode case mappings.  This means that converting a single
character to another case may result in a sequence of more than one character.
For example, the uppercase of C&lt;E&lt;223&gt;&gt; (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) is the two
character sequence C&lt;SS&gt;.  This presents some complications   The lowercase of
all characters in the range 0..255 is a single character, and thus
C&lt;L&lt;/toLOWER_L1&gt;&gt; is furnished.  But, C&lt;toUPPER_L1&gt; can&#39;t exist, as it couldn&#39;t
return a valid result for all legal inputs.  Instead C&lt;L&lt;/toUPPER_uvchr&gt;&gt; has
an API that does allow every possible legal result to be returned.)  Likewise
no other function that is crippled by not being able to give the correct
results for the full range of possible inputs has been implemented here.


=over 8

=item toFOLD
X&lt;toFOLD&gt;

Converts the specified character to foldcase.  If the input is anything but an

=head1 Character classification

This section is about functions (really macros) that classify characters
into types, such as punctuation versus alphabetic, etc.  Most of these are
analogous to regular expression character classes.  (See
L&lt;perlrecharclass/POSIX Character Classes&gt;.)  There are several variants for
each class.  (Not all macros have all variants; each item below lists the
ones valid for it.)  None are affected by C&lt;use bytes&gt;, and only the ones
with C&lt;LC&gt; in the name are affected by the current locale.

The base function, e.g., C&lt;isALPHA()&gt;, takes an octet (either a C&lt;char&gt; or a
C&lt;U8&gt;) as input and returns a boolean as to whether or not the character
represented by that octet is (or on non-ASCII platforms, corresponds to) an
ASCII character in the named class based on platform, Unicode, and Perl rules.
If the input is a number that doesn&#39;t fit in an octet, FALSE is returned.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_A&gt; (e.g., C&lt;isALPHA_A()&gt;) is identical to the base function
with no suffix C&lt;&quot;_A&quot;&gt;.  This variant is used to emphasize by its name that
only ASCII-range characters can return TRUE.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_L1&gt; imposes the Latin-1 (or EBCDIC equivalent) character set
onto the platform.  That is, the code points that are ASCII are unaffected,
since ASCII is a subset of Latin-1.  But the non-ASCII code points are treated
as if they are Latin-1 characters.  For example, C&lt;isWORDCHAR_L1()&gt; will return
true when called with the code point 0xDF, which is a word character in both
ASCII and EBCDIC (though it represents different characters in each).

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_uvchr&gt; is like the C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_L1&gt; variant, but accepts any UV code
point as input.  If the code point is larger than 255, Unicode rules are used
to determine if it is in the character class.  For example,
C&lt;isWORDCHAR_uvchr(0x100)&gt; returns TRUE, since 0x100 is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
WITH MACRON in Unicode, and is a word character.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8_safe&gt; is like C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_uvchr&gt;, but is used for UTF-8
encoded strings.  Each call classifies one character, even if the string
contains many.  This variant takes two parameters.  The first, C&lt;p&gt;, is a
pointer to the first byte of the character to be classified.  (Recall that it
may take more than one byte to represent a character in UTF-8 strings.)  The
second parameter, C&lt;e&gt;, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first
character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.  The suffix
C&lt;_safe&gt; in the function&#39;s name indicates that it will not attempt to read
beyond S&lt;C&lt;e - 1&gt;&gt;, provided that the constraint S&lt;C&lt;s E&lt;lt&gt; e&gt;&gt; is true (this
is asserted for in C&lt;-DDEBUGGING&gt; builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8&gt; is like C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8_safe&gt;, but takes just a single
parameter, C&lt;p&gt;, which has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter does
in C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8_safe&gt;.  The function therefore can&#39;t check if it is reading
beyond the end of the string.  Starting in Perl v5.30, it will take a second
parameter, becoming a synonym for C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8_safe&gt;.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8&gt; from each call point in the
program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can convert
your program now to use C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_utf8_safe&gt;, and avoid the warnings, and get an
extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when you&#39;ll be forced
to add the C&lt;e&gt; parameter.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC&gt; is like the C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_A&gt; and C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_L1&gt; variants, but the
result is based on the current locale, which is what C&lt;LC&gt; in the name stands
for.  If Perl can determine that the current locale is a UTF-8 locale, it uses
the published Unicode rules; otherwise, it uses the C library function that
gives the named classification.  For example, C&lt;isDIGIT_LC()&gt; when not in a
UTF-8 locale returns the result of calling C&lt;isdigit()&gt;.  FALSE is always
returned if the input won&#39;t fit into an octet.  On some platforms where the C
library function is known to be defective, Perl changes its result to follow
the POSIX standard&#39;s rules.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_uvchr&gt; is like C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC&gt;, but is defined on any UV.  It
returns the same as C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC&gt; for input code points less than 256, and
returns the hard-coded, not-affected-by-locale, Unicode results for larger ones.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8_safe&gt; is like C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_uvchr&gt;, but is used for UTF-8
encoded strings.  Each call classifies one character, even if the string
contains many.  This variant takes two parameters.  The first, C&lt;p&gt;, is a
pointer to the first byte of the character to be classified.  (Recall that it
may take more than one byte to represent a character in UTF-8 strings.) The
second parameter, C&lt;e&gt;, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first
character, up to one byte past the end of the entire string.  The suffix
C&lt;_safe&gt; in the function&#39;s name indicates that it will not attempt to read
beyond S&lt;C&lt;e - 1&gt;&gt;, provided that the constraint S&lt;C&lt;s E&lt;lt&gt; e&gt;&gt; is true (this
is asserted for in C&lt;-DDEBUGGING&gt; builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Variant C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8&gt; is like C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8_safe&gt;, but takes just a single
parameter, C&lt;p&gt;, which has the same meaning as the corresponding parameter does
in C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8_safe&gt;.  The function therefore can&#39;t check if it is reading

parameter, becoming a synonym for C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8_safe&gt;.  At that time every
program that uses it will have to be changed to successfully compile.  In the
meantime, the first runtime call to C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8&gt; from each call point in
the program will raise a deprecation warning, enabled by default.  You can
convert your program now to use C&lt;isI&lt;FOO&gt;_LC_utf8_safe&gt;, and avoid the warnings,
and get an extra measure of protection, or you can wait until v5.30, when

=item isPSXSPC
X&lt;isPSXSPC&gt;

(short for Posix Space)
Starting in 5.18, this is identical in all its forms to the
corresponding C&lt;isSPACE()&gt; macros.
The locale forms of this macro are identical to their corresponding
C&lt;isSPACE()&gt; forms in all Perl releases.  In releases prior to 5.18, the
non-locale forms differ from their C&lt;isSPACE()&gt; forms only in that the
C&lt;isSPACE()&gt; forms don&#39;t match a Vertical Tab, and the C&lt;isPSXSPC()&gt; forms do.
Otherwise they are identical.  Thus this macro is analogous to what
C&lt;m/[[:space:]]/&gt; matches in a regular expression.

to what C&lt;m/\s/&gt; matches in a regular expression.  Starting in Perl 5.18
this also matches what C&lt;m/[[:space:]]/&gt; does.  Prior to 5.18, only the
locale forms of this macro (the ones with C&lt;LC&gt; in their names) matched
precisely what C&lt;m/[[:space:]]/&gt; does.  In those releases, the only difference,
in the non-locale variants, was that C&lt;isSPACE()&gt; did not match a vertical tab.

Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified character is a character
that is a word character, analogous to what C&lt;m/\w/&gt; and C&lt;m/[[:word:]]/&gt; match
in a regular expression.  A word character is an alphabetic character, a
decimal digit, a connecting punctuation character (such as an underscore), or
a &quot;mark&quot; character that attaches to one of those (like some sort of accent).
C&lt;isALNUM()&gt; is a synonym provided for backward compatibility, even though a
word character includes more than the standard C language meaning of
alphanumeric.

=head1 Cloning an interpreter

=over 8

=item perl_clone
X&lt;perl_clone&gt;

Create and return a new interpreter by cloning the current one.

C&lt;perl_clone&gt; takes these flags as parameters:

C&lt;CLONEf_COPY_STACKS&gt; - is used to, well, copy the stacks also,
without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks,
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one.
The pseudo-fork code uses C&lt;COPY_STACKS&gt; while the
threads-&gt;create doesn&#39;t.

C&lt;CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE&gt; -
C&lt;perl_clone&gt; keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old
variable as a key and the new variable as a value,
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not
clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the
refcount.  If C&lt;KEEP_PTR_TABLE&gt; is not set then C&lt;perl_clone&gt; will kill
the ptr_table using the function
C&lt;ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;&gt;,
reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own
variable who are outside the graph perl scans, an example of this
code is in F&lt;threads.xs&gt; create.

C&lt;CLONEf_CLONE_HOST&gt; -
This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on
win32 if you want to run two threads at the same time,
if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter
and then throw it away and return to the original one,
you don&#39;t need to do anything.

This macro does call a function.  Prior

this will return a default value.  The return type depends
on C&lt;which&gt;.  This macro evaluates its arguments more than

This section documents functions to manipulate CVs which are code-values,
or subroutines.  For more information, see L&lt;perlguts&gt;.


=over 8

=item caller_cx
X&lt;caller_cx&gt;

The XSUB-writer&#39;s equivalent of L&lt;caller()|perlfunc/caller&gt;.  The
returned C&lt;PERL_CONTEXT&gt; structure can be interrogated to find all the
information returned to Perl by C&lt;caller&gt;.  Note that XSUBs don&#39;t get a
stack frame, so C&lt;caller_cx(0, NULL)&gt; will return information for the
immediately-surrounding Perl code.

This function skips over the automatic calls to C&lt;&amp;DB::sub&gt; made on the
behalf of the debugger.  If the stack frame requested was a sub called by
C&lt;DB::sub&gt;, the return value will be the frame for the call to
C&lt;DB::sub&gt;, since that has the correct line number/etc. for the call
site.  If I&lt;dbcxp&gt; is non-C&lt;NULL&gt;, it will be set to a pointer to the
frame for the sub call itself.

	const PERL_CONTEXT * caller_cx(
	                         I32 level,

C&lt;*db_seqp&gt; with the cop sequence number at the point that the DB:: code was
entered.  (This allows debuggers to eval in the scope of the breakpoint
rather than in the scope of the debugger itself.)

=item get_cvn_flags
X&lt;get_cvn_flags&gt;

Returns the CV of the specified Perl subroutine.  C&lt;flags&gt; are passed to
C&lt;gv_fetchpvn_flags&gt;.  If C&lt;GV_ADD&gt; is set and the Perl subroutine does not
exist then it will be declared (which has the same effect as saying
C&lt;sub name;&gt;).  If C&lt;GV_ADD&gt; is not set and the subroutine does not exist
then NULL is returned.

except that an additional &quot;\0&quot; will be appended to the string when
len &gt; cur and pv[cur] is &quot;\0&quot;.

Note that the final string may be up to 7 chars longer than pvlim.

		           STRLEN len, STRLEN pvlim)

=item pv_escape
X&lt;pv_escape&gt;

Escapes at most the first C&lt;count&gt; chars of C&lt;pv&gt; and puts the results into
C&lt;dsv&gt; such that the size of the escaped string will not exceed C&lt;max&gt; chars
and will not contain any incomplete escape sequences.  The number of bytes
escaped will be returned in the C&lt;STRLEN *escaped&gt; parameter if it is not null.
When the C&lt;dsv&gt; parameter is null no escaping actually occurs, but the number
of bytes that would be escaped were it not null will be calculated.

If flags contains C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE&gt; then any double quotes in the string
will also be escaped.

Normally the SV will be cleared before the escaped string is prepared,
but when C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOCLEAR&gt; is set this will not occur.

If C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI&gt; is set then the input string is treated as UTF-8
if C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI_DETECT&gt; is set then the input string is scanned
using C&lt;is_utf8_string()&gt; to determine if it is UTF-8.

If C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_ALL&gt; is set then all input chars will be output
using C&lt;\x01F1&gt; style escapes, otherwise if C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NONASCII&gt; is set, only
non-ASCII chars will be escaped using this style; otherwise, only chars above
255 will be so escaped; other non printable chars will use octal or
common escaped patterns like C&lt;\n&gt;.
Otherwise, if C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOBACKSLASH&gt;
then all chars below 255 will be treated as printable and
will be output as literals.

If C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_FIRSTCHAR&gt; is set then only the first char of the
string will be escaped, regardless of max.  If the output is to be in hex,
then it will be returned as a plain hex
sequence.  Thus the output will either be a single char,
an octal escape sequence, a special escape like C&lt;\n&gt; or a hex value.

If C&lt;PERL_PV_ESCAPE_RE&gt; is set then the escape char used will be a C&lt;&quot;%&quot;&gt; and
not a C&lt;&quot;\\&quot;&gt;.  This is because regexes very often contain backslashed
sequences, whereas C&lt;&quot;%&quot;&gt; is not a particularly common character in patterns.

Returns a pointer to the escaped text as held by C&lt;dsv&gt;.

Converts a string into something presentable, handling escaping via

If the C&lt;PERL_PV_PRETTY_QUOTE&gt; flag is set then the result will be
double quoted with any double quotes in the string escaped.  Otherwise
if the C&lt;PERL_PV_PRETTY_LTGT&gt; flag is set then the result be wrapped in
angle brackets. 

If the C&lt;PERL_PV_PRETTY_ELLIPSES&gt; flag is set and not all characters in
string were output then an ellipsis C&lt;...&gt; will be appended to the
string.  Note that this happens AFTER it has been quoted.

If C&lt;start_color&gt; is non-null then it will be inserted after the opening
quote (if there is one) but before the escaped text.  If C&lt;end_color&gt;
is non-null then it will be inserted after the escaped text but before
any quotes or ellipses.

Returns a pointer to the prettified text as held by C&lt;dsv&gt;.

Clone a CV, making a lexical closure.  C&lt;proto&gt; supplies the prototype

string already holding the sub name, but this could change in the future.

An SV may be passed as a second argument.  If so, the name will be assigned

X&lt;load_module&gt;

Loads the module whose name is pointed to by the string part of C&lt;name&gt;.
Note that the actual module name, not its filename, should be given.
Eg, &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; instead of &quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot;. ver, if specified and not NULL,
provides version semantics similar to C&lt;use Foo::Bar VERSION&gt;. The optional
trailing arguments can be used to specify arguments to the module&#39;s C&lt;import()&gt;
method, similar to C&lt;use Foo::Bar VERSION LIST&gt;; their precise handling depends
on the flags. The flags argument is a bitwise-ORed collection of any of
C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_DENY&gt;, C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT&gt;, or C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS&gt;
(or 0 for no flags).

If C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT&gt; is set, the module is loaded as if with an empty
import list, as in C&lt;use Foo::Bar ()&gt;; this is the only circumstance in which
the trailing optional arguments may be omitted entirely. Otherwise, if
C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS&gt; is set, the trailing arguments must consist of
exactly one C&lt;OP*&gt;, containing the op tree that produces the relevant import
arguments. Otherwise, the trailing arguments must all be C&lt;SV*&gt; values that
will be used as import arguments; and the list must be terminated with C&lt;(SV*)
NULL&gt;. If neither C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT&gt; nor C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS&gt; is
set, the trailing C&lt;NULL&gt; pointer is needed even if no import arguments are
desired. The reference count for each specified C&lt;SV*&gt; argument is
decremented. In addition, the C&lt;name&gt; argument is modified.

If C&lt;PERL_LOADMOD_DENY&gt; is set, the module is loaded as if with C&lt;no&gt; rather
than C&lt;use&gt;.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Allocates a place in the currently-compiling pad,
returning the offset of the allocated pad slot.
No name is initially attached to the pad slot.
C&lt;tmptype&gt; is a set of flags indicating the kind of pad entry required,
which will be set in the value SV for the allocated pad entry:

    SVs_PADMY    named lexical variable (&quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;state&quot;)
    SVs_PADTMP   unnamed temporary store
    SVf_READONLY constant shared between recursion levels

C&lt;SVf_READONLY&gt; has been supported here only since perl 5.20.  To work with
earlier versions as well, use C&lt;SVf_READONLY|SVs_PADTMP&gt;.  C&lt;SVf_READONLY&gt;
does not cause the SV in the pad slot to be marked read-only, but simply
tells C&lt;pad_alloc&gt; that it I&lt;will&gt; be made read-only (by the caller), or at
least should be treated as such.

C&lt;optype&gt; should be an opcode indicating the type of operation that the
pad entry is to support.  This doesn&#39;t affect operational semantics,
but is used for debugging.

=item PL_check
X&lt;PL_check&gt;

Array, indexed by opcode, of functions that will be called for the &quot;check&quot;
phase of optree building during compilation of Perl code.  For most (but
not all) types of op, once the op has been initially built and populated
with child ops it will be filtered through the check function referenced
by the appropriate element of this array.  The new op is passed in as the
sole argument to the check function, and the check function returns the
completed op.  The check function may (as the name suggests) check the op
for validity and signal errors.  It may also initialise or modify parts of
the ops, or perform more radical surgery such as adding or removing child
ops, or even throw the op away and return a different op in its place.

This array of function pointers is a convenient place to hook into the
compilation process.  An XS module can put its own custom check function
in place of any of the standard ones, to influence the compilation of a
particular type of op.  However, a custom check function must never fully
replace a standard check function (or even a custom check function from
another module).  A module modifying checking must instead B&lt;wrap&gt; the
preexisting check function.  A custom check function must be selective
about when to apply its custom behaviour.  In the usual case where
it decides not to do anything special with an op, it must chain the
preexisting op function.  Check functions are thus linked in a chain,
with the core&#39;s base checker at the end.

For thread safety, modules should not write directly to this array.
Instead, use the function L&lt;/wrap_op_checker&gt;.

=item PL_keyword_plugin
X&lt;PL_keyword_plugin&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Function pointer, pointing at a function used to handle extended keywords.
The function should be declared as

	int keyword_plugin_function(pTHX_
		char *keyword_ptr, STRLEN keyword_len,
		OP **op_ptr)

The function is called from the tokeniser, whenever a possible keyword
is seen.  C&lt;keyword_ptr&gt; points at the word in the parser&#39;s input
buffer, and C&lt;keyword_len&gt; gives its length; it is not null-terminated.
The function is expected to examine the word, and possibly other state
such as L&lt;%^H|perlvar/%^H&gt;, to decide whether it wants to handle it
as an extended keyword.  If it does not, the function should return
C&lt;KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE&gt;, and the normal parser process will continue.

If the function wants to handle the keyword, it first must
parse anything following the keyword that is part of the syntax
introduced by the keyword.  See L&lt;/Lexer interface&gt; for details.

When a keyword is being handled, the plugin function must build
a tree of C&lt;OP&gt; structures, representing the code that was parsed.
The root of the tree must be stored in C&lt;*op_ptr&gt;.  The function then
returns a constant indicating the syntactic role of the construct that
it has parsed: C&lt;KEYWORD_PLUGIN_STMT&gt; if it is a complete statement, or
C&lt;KEYWORD_PLUGIN_EXPR&gt; if it is an expression.  Note that a statement
construct cannot be used inside an expression (except via C&lt;do BLOCK&gt;
and similar), and an expression is not a complete statement (it requires
at least a terminating semicolon).

When a keyword is handled, the plugin function may also have
(compile-time) side effects.  It may modify C&lt;%^H&gt;, define functions, and
so on.  Typically, if side effects are the main purpose of a handler,
it does not wish to generate any ops to be included in the normal
compilation.  In this case it is still required to supply an op tree,
but it suffices to generate a single null op.

That&#39;s how the C&lt;*PL_keyword_plugin&gt; function needs to behave overall.
Conventionally, however, one does not completely replace the existing
handler function.  Instead, take a copy of C&lt;PL_keyword_plugin&gt; before
assigning your own function pointer to it.  Your handler function should
look for keywords that it is interested in and handle those.  Where it
is not interested, it should call the saved plugin function, passing on
the arguments it received.  Thus C&lt;PL_keyword_plugin&gt; actually points
at a chain of handler functions, all of which have an opportunity to
handle keywords, and only the last function in the chain (built into
the Perl core) will normally return C&lt;KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE&gt;.

=head1 GV Functions

A GV is a structure which corresponds to to a Perl typeglob, ie *foo.
It is a structure that holds a pointer to a scalar, an array, a hash etc,

Perl stores its global variables.

=item gv_fetchmethod_autoload
X&lt;gv_fetchmethod_autoload&gt;

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C&lt;stash&gt;.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;.  In this case the corresponding variable C&lt;$AUTOLOAD&gt; is
already setup.

The third parameter of C&lt;gv_fetchmethod_autoload&gt; determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don&#39;t look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C&lt;gv_fetchmethod&gt; is equivalent to calling C&lt;gv_fetchmethod_autoload&gt;
with a non-zero C&lt;autoload&gt; parameter.

These functions grant C&lt;&quot;SUPER&quot;&gt; token
as a prefix of the method name.  Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;, since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to C&lt;$AUTOLOAD&gt; changing its value.  Use the glob
created as a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects as C&lt;gv_fetchmeth&gt; with
C&lt;level==0&gt;.  The warning against passing the GV returned by
C&lt;gv_fetchmeth&gt; to C&lt;call_sv&gt; applies equally to these functions.

=item gv_fetchmeth_pvn
X&lt;gv_fetchmeth_pvn&gt;

Returns the glob with the given C&lt;name&gt; and a defined subroutine or
C&lt;NULL&gt;.  The glob lives in the given C&lt;stash&gt;, or in the stashes
accessible via C&lt;@ISA&gt; and C&lt;UNIVERSAL::&gt;.

The argument C&lt;level&gt; should be either 0 or -1.  If C&lt;level==0&gt;, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C&lt;name&gt; in the given C&lt;stash&gt;
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.

The only significant values for C&lt;flags&gt; are C&lt;GV_SUPER&gt; and C&lt;SVf_UTF8&gt;.

C&lt;GV_SUPER&gt; indicates that we want to look up the method in the superclasses
of the C&lt;stash&gt;.

The
GV returned from C&lt;gv_fetchmeth&gt; may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C&lt;call_sv&gt;, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method&#39;s CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C&lt;GvCV&gt; macro.

	GV*	gv_fetchmeth_pvn(HV* stash, const char* name,

For an autoloaded subroutine without a GV, will create a GV even
if C&lt;level &lt; 0&gt;.  For an autoloaded subroutine without a stub, C&lt;GvCV()&gt;

=item gv_init_pvn
X&lt;gv_init_pvn&gt;

Converts a scalar into a typeglob.  This is an incoercible typeglob;
assigning a reference to it will assign to one of its slots, instead of
overwriting it as happens with typeglobs created by C&lt;SvSetSV&gt;.  Converting
any scalar that is C&lt;SvOK()&gt; may produce unpredictable results and is reserved
for perl&#39;s internal use.

C&lt;gv&gt; is the scalar to be converted.

C&lt;stash&gt; is the parent stash/package, if any.

C&lt;name&gt; and C&lt;len&gt; give the name.  The name must be unqualified;
that is, it must not include the package name.  If C&lt;gv&gt; is a
stash element, it is the caller&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the name
passed to this function matches the name of the element.  If it does not
match, perl&#39;s internal bookkeeping will get out of sync.

C&lt;flags&gt; can be set to C&lt;SVf_UTF8&gt; if C&lt;name&gt; is a UTF-8 string, or
the return value of SvUTF8(sv).  It can also take the

to C&lt;gv_fetchpvn_flags()&gt;, so if set to C&lt;GV_ADD&gt; then the package will be
created if it does not already exist.  If the package does not exist and

=head1 Hash Manipulation Functions

A HV structure represents a Perl hash.  It consists mainly of an array
of pointers, each of which points to a linked list of HE structures.  The
array is indexed by the hash function of the key, so each linked list
represents all the hash entries with the same hash value.  Each HE contains
a pointer to the actual value, plus a pointer to a HEK structure which
holds the key and hash value.

is to be expected.  (For information only--not to be used).

C&lt;HeKLEN()&gt;.  Can be assigned to.  The C&lt;HePV()&gt; or C&lt;HeSVKEY()&gt; macros are

X&lt;HePV&gt;

Returns the key slot of the hash entry as a C&lt;char*&gt; value, doing any
necessary dereferencing of possibly C&lt;SV*&gt; keys.  The length of the string
is placed in C&lt;len&gt; (this is a macro, so do I&lt;not&gt; use C&lt;&amp;len&gt;).  If you do
not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the global
variable C&lt;PL_na&gt;, though this is rather less efficient than using a local
variable.  Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain
embedded nulls, so using C&lt;strlen()&gt; or similar is not a good way to find
the length of hash keys.  This is very similar to the C&lt;SvPV()&gt; macro
described elsewhere in this document.  See also C&lt;L&lt;/HeUTF8&gt;&gt;.

If you are using C&lt;HePV&gt; to get values to pass to C&lt;newSVpvn()&gt; to create a

deleted but is marked by assigning it a value of C&lt;&amp;PL_sv_placeholder&gt;.  This tags
it so it will be ignored by future operations such as iterating over the hash,
but will still allow the hash to have a value reassigned to the key at some
future point.  This function clears any such placeholder keys from the hash.

=item hv_store
X&lt;hv_store&gt;

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C&lt;key&gt; and the
absolute value of C&lt;klen&gt; is the length of the key.  If C&lt;klen&gt; is
negative the key is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  The
C&lt;hash&gt; parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then
Perl will compute it.

The return value will be
C&lt;NULL&gt; if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C&lt;SV*&gt;.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C&lt;val&gt; before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned C&lt;NULL&gt;.  Effectively
a successful C&lt;hv_store&gt; takes ownership of one reference to C&lt;val&gt;.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, C&lt;hv_store&gt;
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn&#39;t need to do
anything further to tidy up.  C&lt;hv_store&gt; is not implemented as a call to
C&lt;hv_store_ent&gt;, and does not create a temporary SV for the key, so if your
key data is not already in SV form then use C&lt;hv_store&gt; in preference to
C&lt;hv_store_ent&gt;.

X&lt;hv_store_ent&gt;

Stores C&lt;val&gt; in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C&lt;key&gt;.  The C&lt;hash&gt;
parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will
compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
C&lt;NULL&gt; if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C&lt;He?&gt; macros

incrementing the reference count of C&lt;val&gt; before the call, and
decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively a successful
C&lt;hv_store_ent&gt; takes ownership of one reference to C&lt;val&gt;.  This is

unlike C&lt;val&gt; it does not take ownership of it, so maintaining the correct
reference count on C&lt;key&gt; is entirely the caller&#39;s responsibility.  C&lt;hv_store&gt;
is not implemented as a call to C&lt;hv_store_ent&gt;, and does not create a temporary

=head1 Hook manipulation

These functions provide convenient and thread-safe means of manipulating
hook variables.


=over 8

=item wrap_op_checker
X&lt;wrap_op_checker&gt;

Puts a C function into the chain of check functions for a specified op
type.  This is the preferred way to manipulate the L&lt;/PL_check&gt; array.
C&lt;opcode&gt; specifies which type of op is to be affected.  C&lt;new_checker&gt;
is a pointer to the C function that is to be added to that opcode&#39;s
check chain, and C&lt;old_checker_p&gt; points to the storage location where a
pointer to the next function in the chain will be stored.  The value of
C&lt;new_pointer&gt; is written into the L&lt;/PL_check&gt; array, while the value
previously stored there is written to C&lt;*old_checker_p&gt;.

The function should be defined like this:

    static OP *new_checker(pTHX_ OP *op) { ... }

It is intended to be called in this manner:

    new_checker(aTHX_ op)

C&lt;old_checker_p&gt; should be defined like this:

    static Perl_check_t old_checker_p;

L&lt;/PL_check&gt; is global to an entire process, and a module wishing to
hook op checking may find itself invoked more than once per process,
typically in different threads.  To handle that situation, this function
is idempotent.  The location C&lt;*old_checker_p&gt; must initially (once
per process) contain a null pointer.  A C variable of static duration
(declared at file scope, typically also marked C&lt;static&gt; to give
it internal linkage) will be implicitly initialised appropriately,
if it does not have an explicit initialiser.  This function will only
actually modify the check chain if it finds C&lt;*old_checker_p&gt; to be null.
This function is also thread safe on the small scale.  It uses appropriate
locking to avoid race conditions in accessing L&lt;/PL_check&gt;.

When this function is called, the function referenced by C&lt;new_checker&gt;
must be ready to be called, except for C&lt;*old_checker_p&gt; being unfilled.
In a threading situation, C&lt;new_checker&gt; may be called immediately,
even before this function has returned.  C&lt;*old_checker_p&gt; will always
be appropriately set before C&lt;new_checker&gt; is called.  If C&lt;new_checker&gt;
decides not to do anything special with an op that it is given (which
is the usual case for most uses of op check hooking), it must chain the
check function referenced by C&lt;*old_checker_p&gt;.

If you want to influence compilation of calls to a specific subroutine,
then use L&lt;/cv_set_call_checker&gt; rather than hooking checking of all
C&lt;entersub&gt; ops.

=head1 Lexer interface

This is the lower layer of the Perl parser, managing characters and tokens.


=over 8

=item lex_bufutf8
X&lt;lex_bufutf8&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Indicates whether the octets in the lexer buffer
(L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt;) should be interpreted as the UTF-8 encoding
of Unicode characters.  If not, they should be interpreted as Latin-1
characters.  This is analogous to the C&lt;SvUTF8&gt; flag for scalars.

In UTF-8 mode, it is not guaranteed that the lexer buffer actually
contains valid UTF-8.  Lexing code must be robust in the face of invalid
encoding.

The actual C&lt;SvUTF8&gt; flag of the L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt; scalar
is significant, but not the whole story regarding the input character
encoding.  Normally, when a file is being read, the scalar contains octets
and its C&lt;SvUTF8&gt; flag is off, but the octets should be interpreted as
UTF-8 if the C&lt;use utf8&gt; pragma is in effect.  During a string eval,
however, the scalar may have the C&lt;SvUTF8&gt; flag on, and in this case its
octets should be interpreted as UTF-8 unless the C&lt;use bytes&gt; pragma
is in effect.  This logic may change in the future; use this function
instead of implementing the logic yourself.

Discards the first part of the L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt; buffer,
up to C&lt;ptr&gt;.  The remaining content of the buffer will be moved, and
all pointers into the buffer updated appropriately.  C&lt;ptr&gt; must not
be later in the buffer than the position of L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt;:
it is not permitted to discard text that has yet to be lexed.

Normally it is not necessarily to do this directly, because it suffices to
use the implicit discarding behaviour of L&lt;/lex_next_chunk&gt; and things
based on it.  However, if a token stretches across multiple lines,
and the lexing code has kept multiple lines of text in the buffer for
that purpose, then after completion of the token it would be wise to
explicitly discard the now-unneeded earlier lines, to avoid future
multi-line tokens growing the buffer without bound.

Reallocates the lexer buffer (L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt;) to accommodate
at least C&lt;len&gt; octets (including terminating C&lt;NUL&gt;).  Returns a
pointer to the reallocated buffer.  This is necessary before making
any direct modification of the buffer that would increase its length.
L&lt;/lex_stuff_pvn&gt; provides a more convenient way to insert text into
the buffer.

Do not use C&lt;SvGROW&gt; or C&lt;sv_grow&gt; directly on C&lt;PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt;;

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Reads in the next chunk of text to be lexed, appending it to
L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt;.  This should be called when lexing code has
looked to the end of the current chunk and wants to know more.  It is
usual, but not necessary, for lexing to have consumed the entirety of
the current chunk at this time.

If L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt; is pointing to the very end of the current
chunk (i.e., the current chunk has been entirely consumed), normally the
current chunk will be discarded at the same time that the new chunk is
read in.  If C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS&gt; bit set, the current chunk
will not be discarded.  If the current chunk has not been entirely
consumed, then it will not be discarded regardless of the flag.

Returns true if some new text was added to the buffer, or false if the
buffer has reached the end of the input text.

Returns the codepoint (unsigned integer value) of the next character,
or -1 if lexing has reached the end of the input text.  To consume the
peeked character, use L&lt;/lex_read_unichar&gt;.

If the next character is in (or extends into) the next chunk of input
text, the next chunk will be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be
discarded at the same time, but if C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS&gt;
bit set, then the current chunk will not be discarded.

If the input is being interpreted as UTF-8 and a UTF-8 encoding error
is encountered, an exception is generated.

Perl-style comments.  C&lt;#line&gt; directives are processed if encountered.
L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt; is moved past the spaces, so that it points
at a non-space character (or the end of the input text).

If spaces extend into the next chunk of input text, the next chunk will
be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be discarded at the same
time, but if C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS&gt; bit set, then the current
chunk will not be discarded.

performing the correct bookkeeping whenever a newline character is passed.
This is the normal way to consume lexed text.

Interpretation of the buffer&#39;s octets can be abstracted out by

Reads the next (Unicode) character in the text currently being lexed.
Returns the codepoint (unsigned integer value) of the character read,
and moves L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt; past the character, or returns -1
if lexing has reached the end of the input text.  To non-destructively
examine the next character, use L&lt;/lex_peek_unichar&gt; instead.

If the next character is in (or extends into) the next chunk of input
text, the next chunk will be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be
discarded at the same time, but if C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS&gt;

X&lt;lex_start&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Creates and initialises a new lexer/parser state object, supplying
a context in which to lex and parse from a new source of Perl code.
A pointer to the new state object is placed in L&lt;/PL_parser&gt;.  An entry
is made on the save stack so that upon unwinding, the new state object
will be destroyed and the former value of L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; will be restored.
Nothing else need be done to clean up the parsing context.

The code to be parsed comes from C&lt;line&gt; and C&lt;rsfp&gt;.  C&lt;line&gt;, if
non-null, provides a string (in SV form) containing code to be parsed.
A copy of the string is made, so subsequent modification of C&lt;line&gt;
does not affect parsing.  C&lt;rsfp&gt;, if non-null, provides an input stream
from which code will be read to be parsed.  If both are non-null, the
code in C&lt;line&gt; comes first and must consist of complete lines of input,
and C&lt;rsfp&gt; supplies the remainder of the source.

The C&lt;flags&gt; parameter is reserved for future use.  Currently it is only
used by perl internally, so extensions should always pass zero.

immediately after the current lexing point (L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt;),
reallocating the buffer if necessary.  This means that lexing code that
runs later will see the characters as if they had appeared in the input.
It is not recommended to do this as part of normal parsing, and most
uses of this facility run the risk of the inserted characters being
interpreted in an unintended manner.

The string to be inserted is represented by octets starting at C&lt;pv&gt;

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Parse a Perl arithmetic expression.  This may contain operators of precedence
down to the bit shift operators.  The expression must be followed (and thus
terminated) either by a comparison or lower-precedence operator or by
something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;PARSE_OPTIONAL&gt; bit set, then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the
dynamic parser state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to reflect
the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the
expression.

The op tree representing the expression is returned.  If an optional
expression is absent, a null pointer is returned, otherwise the pointer
will be non-null.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op
tree is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in the parser state,
normally resulting in a single exception at the top level of parsing
which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.  Some compilation
errors, however, will throw an exception immediately.

Parse a single unadorned Perl statement.  This may be a normal imperative

include any label or other affixture.  It is up to the caller to ensure
that the dynamic parser state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to
reflect the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for
the statement.

The op tree representing the statement is returned.  This may be a
null pointer if the statement is null, for example if it was actually
a subroutine definition (which has compile-time side effects).  If not
null, it will be ops directly implementing the statement, suitable to
pass to L&lt;/newSTATEOP&gt;.  It will not normally include a C&lt;nextstate&gt; or
equivalent op (except for those embedded in a scope contained entirely
within the statement).

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op

Parse a single complete Perl code block.  This consists of an opening

constitutes a lexical scope, so C&lt;my&gt; variables and various compile-time
effects can be contained within it.  It is up to the caller to ensure
that the dynamic parser state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to
reflect the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for

The op tree representing the code block is returned.  This is always a
real op, never a null pointer.  It will normally be a C&lt;lineseq&gt; list,
including C&lt;nextstate&gt; or equivalent ops.  No ops to construct any kind
of runtime scope are included by virtue of it being a block.

as C&lt;or&gt;.  The expression must be followed (and thus terminated) by a
token that an expression would normally be terminated by: end-of-file,
closing bracketing punctuation, semicolon, or one of the keywords that
signals a postfix expression-statement modifier.  If C&lt;flags&gt; has the
C&lt;PARSE_OPTIONAL&gt; bit set, then the expression is optional, otherwise it is
mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the dynamic parser
state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to reflect the source of
the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the expression.

The op tree representing the expression is returned.  If an optional
expression is absent, a null pointer is returned, otherwise the pointer
will be non-null.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op
tree is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in the parser state,
normally resulting in a single exception at the top level of parsing
which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.  Some compilation
errors, however, will throw an exception immediately.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Parse a single complete Perl statement.  This may be a normal imperative
statement or a declaration that has compile-time effect, and may include
optional labels.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the dynamic
parser state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to reflect the source
of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the statement.

The op tree representing the statement is returned.  This may be a
null pointer if the statement is null, for example if it was actually
a subroutine definition (which has compile-time side effects).  If not
null, it will be the result of a L&lt;/newSTATEOP&gt; call, normally including
a C&lt;nextstate&gt; or equivalent op.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op
tree (most likely null) is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in
the parser state, normally resulting in a single exception at the top
level of parsing which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.
Some compilation errors, however, will throw an exception immediately.

The C&lt;flags&gt; parameter is reserved for future use, and must always
be zero.

Parse a single label, possibly optional, of the type that may prefix a
Perl statement.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the dynamic parser
state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to reflect the source of
the code to be parsed.  If C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;PARSE_OPTIONAL&gt; bit set, then the
label is optional, otherwise it is mandatory.

The name of the label is returned in the form of a fresh scalar.  If an
optional label is absent, a null pointer is returned.

If an error occurs in parsing, which can only occur if the label is
mandatory, a valid label is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in
the parser state, normally resulting in a single exception at the top
level of parsing which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.

Parse a Perl list expression.  This may contain operators of precedence
down to the comma operator.  The expression must be followed (and thus
terminated) either by a low-precedence logic operator such as C&lt;or&gt; or by
something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;PARSE_OPTIONAL&gt; bit set, then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the
dynamic parser state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al) is correctly set to reflect

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Parse a sequence of zero or more Perl statements.  These may be normal
imperative statements, including optional labels, or declarations
that have compile-time effect, or any mixture thereof.  The statement
sequence ends when a closing brace or end-of-file is encountered in a
place where a new statement could have validly started.  It is up to
the caller to ensure that the dynamic parser state (L&lt;/PL_parser&gt; et al)
is correctly set to reflect the source of the code to be parsed and the
lexical context for the statements.

The op tree representing the statement sequence is returned.  This may
be a null pointer if the statements were all null, for example if there
were no statements or if there were only subroutine definitions (which
have compile-time side effects).  If not null, it will be a C&lt;lineseq&gt;
list, normally including C&lt;nextstate&gt; or equivalent ops.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op

normally resulting in a single exception at the top level of parsing
which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.  Some compilation

Parse a Perl term expression.  This may contain operators of precedence
down to the assignment operators.  The expression must be followed (and thus
terminated) either by a comma or lower-precedence operator or by
something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;PARSE_OPTIONAL&gt; bit set, then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the

Direct pointer to the end of the chunk of text currently being lexed, the
end of the lexer buffer.  This is equal to C&lt;SvPVX(PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr)
+ SvCUR(PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr)&gt;.  A C&lt;NUL&gt; character (zero octet) is
always located at the end of the buffer, and does not count as part of
the buffer&#39;s contents.

=item PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr
X&lt;PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Points to the current position of lexing inside the lexer buffer.
Characters around this point may be freely examined, within
the range delimited by C&lt;SvPVX(L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt;)&gt; and
L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufend&gt;.  The octets of the buffer may be intended to be
interpreted as either UTF-8 or Latin-1, as indicated by L&lt;/lex_bufutf8&gt;.

Lexing code (whether in the Perl core or not) moves this pointer past
the characters that it consumes.  It is also expected to perform some
bookkeeping whenever a newline character is consumed.  This movement
can be more conveniently performed by the function L&lt;/lex_read_to&gt;,
which handles newlines appropriately.

Interpretation of the buffer&#39;s octets can be abstracted out by
using the slightly higher-level functions L&lt;/lex_peek_unichar&gt; and
L&lt;/lex_read_unichar&gt;.

Points to the start of the current line inside the lexer buffer.
This is useful for indicating at which column an error occurred, and
not much else.  This must be updated by any lexing code that consumes
a newline; the function L&lt;/lex_read_to&gt; handles this detail.

=item PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr
X&lt;PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


Buffer scalar containing the chunk currently under consideration of the
text currently being lexed.  This is always a plain string scalar (for
which C&lt;SvPOK&gt; is true).  It is not intended to be used as a scalar by
normal scalar means; instead refer to the buffer directly by the pointer
variables described below.

The lexer maintains various C&lt;char*&gt; pointers to things in the
C&lt;PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt; buffer.  If C&lt;PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;linestr&gt; is ever
reallocated, all of these pointers must be updated.  Don&#39;t attempt to
do this manually, but rather use L&lt;/lex_grow_linestr&gt; if you need to
reallocate the buffer.

The content of the text chunk in the buffer is commonly exactly one
complete line of input, up to and including a newline terminator,
but there are situations where it is otherwise.  The octets of the
buffer may be intended to be interpreted as either UTF-8 or Latin-1.
The function L&lt;/lex_bufutf8&gt; tells you which.  Do not use the C&lt;SvUTF8&gt;
flag on this scalar, which may disagree with it.

For direct examination of the buffer, the variable
L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufend&gt; points to the end of the buffer.  The current
lexing position is pointed to by L&lt;/PL_parser-E&lt;gt&gt;bufptr&gt;.  Direct use
of these pointers is usually preferable to examination of the scalar
through normal scalar means.

=head1 Locale-related functions and macros

=over 8

=item DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION
X&lt;DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION&gt;

This macro should be used as a statement.  It declares a private variable
(whose name begins with an underscore) that is needed by the other macros in
this section.  Failing to include this correctly should lead to a syntax error.
For compatibility with C89 C compilers it should be placed in a block before
any executable statements.

	void	DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION

=for hackers

=item RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC

This is used in conjunction with one of the macros
L&lt;/STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED&gt;
and
L&lt;/STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING&gt;

to properly restore the C&lt;LC_NUMERIC&gt; state.

A call to L&lt;/DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION&gt; must have been made to
declare at compile time a private variable used by this macro and the two
C&lt;STORE&gt; ones.  This macro should be called as a single statement, not an
expression, but with an empty argument list, like this:

 {
    DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION;
     ...
    RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC();
     ...

	void	RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC()

=for hackers

=item STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING
X&lt;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING&gt;

This is used by XS code that that is C&lt;LC_NUMERIC&gt; locale-aware to force the
locale for category C&lt;LC_NUMERIC&gt; to be what perl thinks is the current
underlying locale.  (The perl interpreter could be wrong about what the
underlying locale actually is if some C or XS code has called the C library
function L&lt;setlocale(3)&gt; behind its back; calling L&lt;/sync_locale&gt; before calling
this macro will update perl&#39;s records.)

A call to L&lt;/DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION&gt; must have been made to
declare at compile time a private variable used by this macro.  This macro
should be called as a single statement, not an expression, but with an empty
argument list, like this:

 {
    DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION;
     ...
    STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING();
     ...
    RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC();
     ...
 }

The private variable is used to save the current locale state, so
that the requisite matching call to L&lt;/RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC&gt; can restore it.

=for hackers
Found in file perl.h

=item STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED
X&lt;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED&gt;

This is used to help wrap XS or C code that that is C&lt;LC_NUMERIC&gt; locale-aware.
This locale category is generally kept set to the C locale by Perl for
backwards compatibility, and because most XS code that reads floating point
values can cope only with the decimal radix character being a dot.

This macro makes sure the current C&lt;LC_NUMERIC&gt; state is set properly, to be
aware of locale if the call to the XS or C code from the Perl program is
from within the scope of a S&lt;C&lt;use locale&gt;&gt;; or to ignore locale if the call is
instead from outside such scope.

This macro is the start of wrapping the C or XS code; the wrap ending is done
by calling the L&lt;/RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC&gt; macro after the operation.  Otherwise
the state can be changed that will adversely affect other XS code.

A call to L&lt;/DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION&gt; must have been made to
declare at compile time a private variable used by this macro.  This macro
should be called as a single statement, not an expression, but with an empty

 {
    DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION;

happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has changed.  Use this function
to do so, before returning to Perl.

=item savepv
X&lt;savepv&gt;

Perl&#39;s version of C&lt;strdup()&gt;.  Returns a pointer to a newly allocated
string which is a duplicate of C&lt;pv&gt;.  The size of the string is
determined by C&lt;strlen()&gt;, which means it may not contain embedded C&lt;NUL&gt;
characters and must have a trailing C&lt;NUL&gt;.  The memory allocated for the new
string can be freed with the C&lt;Safefree()&gt; function.

On some platforms, Windows for example, all allocated memory owned by a thread
is deallocated when that thread ends.  So if you need that not to happen, you
need to use the shared memory functions, such as C&lt;L&lt;/savesharedpv&gt;&gt;.

X&lt;get_c_backtrace_dump&gt;

Returns a SV containing a dump of C&lt;depth&gt; frames of the call stack, skipping
the C&lt;skip&gt; innermost ones.  C&lt;depth&gt; of 20 is usually enough.

The appended output looks like:

...
1   10e004812:0082   Perl_croak   util.c:1716    /usr/bin/perl
2   10df8d6d2:1d72   perl_parse   perl.c:3975    /usr/bin/perl
...

The fields are tab-separated.  The first column is the depth (zero
being the innermost non-skipped frame).  In the hex:offset, the hex is
where the program counter was in C&lt;S_parse_body&gt;, and the :offset (might
be missing) tells how much inside the C&lt;S_parse_body&gt; the program counter was.

The C&lt;util.c:1716&gt; is the source code file and line number.

The F&lt;/usr/bin/perl&gt; is obvious (hopefully).

Unknowns are C&lt;&quot;-&quot;&gt;.  Unknowns can happen unfortunately quite easily:
if the platform doesn&#39;t support retrieving the information;
if the binary is missing the debug information;
if the optimizer has transformed the code by for example inlining.

X&lt;mess_sv&gt;

Expands a message, intended for the user, to include an indication of
the current location in the code, if the message does not already appear
to be complete.

C&lt;basemsg&gt; is the initial message or object.  If it is a reference, it
will be used as-is and will be the result of this function.  Otherwise it
is used as a string, and if it already ends with a newline, it is taken
to be complete, and the result of this function will be the same string.
If the message does not end with a newline, then a segment such as C&lt;at
foo.pl line 37&gt; will be appended, and possibly other clauses indicating
the current state of execution.  The resulting message will end with a
dot and a newline.

Normally, the resulting message is returned in a new mortal SV.
During global destruction a single SV may be shared between uses of this
function.  If C&lt;consume&gt; is true, then the function is permitted (but not
required) to modify and return C&lt;basemsg&gt; instead of allocating a new SV.

=item my_strlcat
X&lt;my_strlcat&gt;

The C library C&lt;strlcat&gt; if available, or a Perl implementation of it.
This operates on C C&lt;NUL&gt;-terminated strings.

C&lt;my_strlcat()&gt; appends string C&lt;src&gt; to the end of C&lt;dst&gt;.  It will append at
most S&lt;C&lt;size - strlen(dst) - 1&gt;&gt; characters.  It will then C&lt;NUL&gt;-terminate,
unless C&lt;size&gt; is 0 or the original C&lt;dst&gt; string was longer than C&lt;size&gt; (in
practice this should not happen as it means that either C&lt;size&gt; is incorrect or
that C&lt;dst&gt; is not a proper C&lt;NUL&gt;-terminated string).

Note that C&lt;size&gt; is the full size of the destination buffer and
the result is guaranteed to be C&lt;NUL&gt;-terminated if there is room.  Note that
room for the C&lt;NUL&gt; should be included in C&lt;size&gt;.

The return value is the total length that C&lt;dst&gt; would have if C&lt;size&gt; is
sufficiently large.  Thus it is the initial length of C&lt;dst&gt; plus the length of
C&lt;src&gt;.  If C&lt;size&gt; is smaller than the return, the excess was not appended.

to C&lt;dst&gt;, C&lt;NUL&gt;-terminating the result if C&lt;size&gt; is not 0.

=item ninstr
X&lt;ninstr&gt;

Find the first (leftmost) occurrence of a sequence of bytes within another
sequence.  This is the Perl version of C&lt;strstr()&gt;, extended to handle
arbitrary sequences, potentially containing embedded C&lt;NUL&gt; characters (C&lt;NUL&gt;
is what the initial C&lt;n&gt; in the function name stands for; some systems have an
equivalent, C&lt;memmem()&gt;, but with a somewhat different API).

Another way of thinking about this function is finding a needle in a haystack.
C&lt;big&gt; points to the first byte in the haystack.  C&lt;big_end&gt; points to one byte
beyond the final byte in the haystack.  C&lt;little&gt; points to the first byte in
the needle.  C&lt;little_end&gt; points to one byte beyond the final byte in the
needle.  All the parameters must be non-C&lt;NULL&gt;.

The function returns C&lt;NULL&gt; if there is no occurrence of C&lt;little&gt; within
C&lt;big&gt;.  If C&lt;little&gt; is the empty string, C&lt;big&gt; is returned.

Because this function operates at the byte level, and because of the inherent
characteristics of UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC), it will work properly if both the
needle and the haystack are strings with the same UTF-8ness, but not if the
UTF-8ness differs.

The format specifier detection is not complete printf-syntax detection,
but it should catch most common cases.

If true is returned, those arguments B&lt;should&gt; in theory be processed
with C&lt;quadmath_snprintf()&gt;, but in case there is more than one such
format specifier (see L&lt;/quadmath_format_single&gt;), and if there is
anything else beyond that one (even just a single byte), they
B&lt;cannot&gt; be processed because C&lt;quadmath_snprintf()&gt; is very strict,

In this case, the code should probably fail.

C&lt;quadmath_format_single()&gt; checks that the intended single spec looks
sane: begins with C&lt;%&gt;, has only one C&lt;%&gt;, ends with C&lt;[efgaEFGA]&gt;,
and has C&lt;Q&gt; before it.  This is not a full &quot;printf syntax check&quot;,
just the basics.

Returns the format if it is valid, NULL if not.

C&lt;quadmath_format_single()&gt; can and will actually patch in the missing

of the given stash, so that they might notice
the changes in this one.

Ideally, all instances of C&lt;PL_sub_generation++&gt; in
perl source outside of F&lt;mro.c&gt; should be
replaced by calls to this.

Perl automatically handles most of the common
ways a method might be redefined.  However, there
are a few ways you could change a method in a stash
without the cache code noticing, in which case you
need to call this method afterwards:

1) Directly manipulating the stash HV entries from
XS code.

2) Assigning a reference to a readonly scalar
constant into a stash entry in order to create
a constant subroutine (like F&lt;constant.pm&gt;
does).

This same method is available from pure perl
via, C&lt;mro::method_changed_in(classname)&gt;.

=item grok_bin
X&lt;grok_bin&gt;

converts a string representing a binary number to numeric form.

On entry C&lt;start&gt; and C&lt;*len&gt; give the string to scan, C&lt;*flags&gt; gives
conversion flags, and C&lt;result&gt; should be C&lt;NULL&gt; or a pointer to an NV.
The scan stops at the end of the string, or the first invalid character.
Unless C&lt;PERL_SCAN_SILENT_ILLDIGIT&gt; is set in C&lt;*flags&gt;, encountering an
invalid character will also trigger a warning.
On return C&lt;*len&gt; is set to the length of the scanned string,
and C&lt;*flags&gt; gives output flags.

If the value is &lt;= C&lt;UV_MAX&gt; it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to C&lt;*result&gt;.  If the value is &gt; C&lt;UV_MAX&gt;, C&lt;grok_bin&gt;
returns C&lt;UV_MAX&gt;, sets C&lt;PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX&gt; in the output flags,
and writes the value to C&lt;*result&gt; (or the value is discarded if C&lt;result&gt;
is NULL).

The binary number may optionally be prefixed with C&lt;&quot;0b&quot;&gt; or C&lt;&quot;b&quot;&gt; unless
C&lt;PERL_SCAN_DISALLOW_PREFIX&gt; is set in C&lt;*flags&gt; on entry.  If
C&lt;PERL_SCAN_ALLOW_UNDERSCORES&gt; is set in C&lt;*flags&gt; then the binary
number may use C&lt;&quot;_&quot;&gt; characters to separate digits.

X&lt;grok_hex&gt;

converts a string representing a hex number to numeric form.

On entry C&lt;start&gt; and C&lt;*len_p&gt; give the string to scan, C&lt;*flags&gt; gives
conversion flags, and C&lt;result&gt; should be C&lt;NULL&gt; or a pointer to an NV.
The scan stops at the end of the string, or the first invalid character.
Unless C&lt;PERL_SCAN_SILENT_ILLDIGIT&gt; is set in C&lt;*flags&gt;, encountering an
invalid character will also trigger a warning.
On return C&lt;*len&gt; is set to the length of the scanned string,
and C&lt;*flags&gt; gives output flags.

If the value is &lt;= C&lt;UV_MAX&gt; it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to C&lt;*result&gt;.  If the value is &gt; C&lt;UV_MAX&gt;, C&lt;grok_hex&gt;
returns C&lt;UV_MAX&gt;, sets C&lt;PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX&gt; in the output flags,
and writes the value to C&lt;*result&gt; (or the value is discarded if C&lt;result&gt;
is C&lt;NULL&gt;).

C&lt;PERL_SCAN_DISALLOW_PREFIX&gt; is set in C&lt;*flags&gt; on entry.  If

  IS_NUMBER_INFINITE
  IS_NUMBER_NAN
  IS_NUMBER_INFINITE | IS_NUMBER_NEG
  IS_NUMBER_NAN | IS_NUMBER_NEG
  0

possibly |-ed with C&lt;IS_NUMBER_TRAILING&gt;.

If an infinity or a not-a-number is recognized, C&lt;*sp&gt; will point to
one byte past the end of the recognized string.  If the recognition fails,
zero is returned, and C&lt;*sp&gt; will not move.

X&lt;grok_number_flags&gt;

Recognise (or not) a number.  The type of the number is returned
(0 if unrecognised), otherwise it is a bit-ORed combination of
C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt;, C&lt;IS_NUMBER_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX&gt;, C&lt;IS_NUMBER_NOT_INT&gt;,
C&lt;IS_NUMBER_NEG&gt;, C&lt;IS_NUMBER_INFINITY&gt;, C&lt;IS_NUMBER_NAN&gt; (defined in perl.h).

If the value of the number can fit in a UV, it is returned in C&lt;*valuep&gt;.
C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt; will be set to indicate that C&lt;*valuep&gt; is valid, C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt;
will never be set unless C&lt;*valuep&gt; is valid, but C&lt;*valuep&gt; may have been assigned
to during processing even though C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt; is not set on return.
If C&lt;valuep&gt; is C&lt;NULL&gt;, C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt; will be set for the same cases as when
C&lt;valuep&gt; is non-C&lt;NULL&gt;, but no actual assignment (or SEGV) will occur.

C&lt;IS_NUMBER_NOT_INT&gt; will be set with C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt; if trailing decimals were
seen (in which case C&lt;*valuep&gt; gives the true value truncated to an integer), and
C&lt;IS_NUMBER_NEG&gt; if the number is negative (in which case C&lt;*valuep&gt; holds the
absolute value).  C&lt;IS_NUMBER_IN_UV&gt; is not set if e notation was used or the
number is larger than a UV.

C&lt;flags&gt; allows only C&lt;PERL_SCAN_TRAILING&gt;, which allows for trailing
non-numeric text on an otherwise successful I&lt;grok&gt;, setting
C&lt;IS_NUMBER_TRAILING&gt; on the result.

X&lt;grok_oct&gt;

converts a string representing an octal number to numeric form.

On entry C&lt;start&gt; and C&lt;*len&gt; give the string to scan, C&lt;*flags&gt; gives
conversion flags, and C&lt;result&gt; should be C&lt;NULL&gt; or a pointer to an NV.
The scan stops at the end of the string, or the first invalid character.
Unless C&lt;PERL_SCAN_SILENT_ILLDIGIT&gt; is set in C&lt;*flags&gt;, encountering an
8 or 9 will also trigger a warning.
On return C&lt;*len&gt; is set to the length of the scanned string,
and C&lt;*flags&gt; gives output flags.

If the value is &lt;= C&lt;UV_MAX&gt; it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to C&lt;*result&gt;.  If the value is &gt; C&lt;UV_MAX&gt;, C&lt;grok_oct&gt;

X&lt;Perl_signbit&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Return a non-zero integer if the sign bit on an NV is set, and 0 if
it is not.  

If F&lt;Configure&gt; detects this system has a C&lt;signbit()&gt; that will work with
our NVs, then we just use it via the C&lt;#define&gt; in F&lt;perl.h&gt;.  Otherwise,
fall back on this implementation.  The main use of this function
is catching C&lt;-0.0&gt;.

C&lt;Configure&gt; notes:  This function is called C&lt;&#39;Perl_signbit&#39;&gt; instead of a
plain C&lt;&#39;signbit&#39;&gt; because it is easy to imagine a system having a C&lt;signbit()&gt;
function or macro that doesn&#39;t happen to work with our particular choice
of NVs.  We shouldn&#39;t just re-C&lt;#define&gt; C&lt;signbit&gt; as C&lt;Perl_signbit&gt; and expect
the standard system headers to be happy.  Also, this is a no-context
function (no C&lt;pTHX_&gt;) because C&lt;Perl_signbit()&gt; is usually re-C&lt;#defined&gt; in
F&lt;perl.h&gt; as a simple macro call to the system&#39;s C&lt;signbit()&gt;.
Users should just always call C&lt;Perl_signbit()&gt;.

Returns the native code point of the first character in the string C&lt;s&gt;

malformed input could cause reading beyond the end of the input buffer, which
is one reason why this function is deprecated.  The other is that only in
extremely limited circumstances should the Unicode versus native code point be
of any interest to you.  See L&lt;/utf8_to_uvuni_buf&gt; for alternatives.

If C&lt;s&gt; points to one of the detected malformations, and UTF8 warnings are
enabled, zero is returned and C&lt;*retlen&gt; is set (if C&lt;retlen&gt; doesn&#39;t point to
NULL) to -1.  If those warnings are off, the computed value if well-defined (or
the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C&lt;*retlen&gt;
is set (if C&lt;retlen&gt; isn&#39;t NULL) so that (S&lt;C&lt;s&gt; + C&lt;*retlen&gt;&gt;) is the
next possible position in C&lt;s&gt; that could begin a non-malformed character.
See L&lt;/utf8n_to_uvchr&gt; for details on when the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned.

Constructs, checks, and returns an assignment op.  C&lt;left&gt; and C&lt;right&gt;
supply the parameters of the assignment; they are consumed by this
function and become part of the constructed op tree.

If C&lt;optype&gt; is C&lt;OP_ANDASSIGN&gt;, C&lt;OP_ORASSIGN&gt;, or C&lt;OP_DORASSIGN&gt;, then
a suitable conditional optree is constructed.  If C&lt;optype&gt; is the opcode
of a binary operator, such as C&lt;OP_BIT_OR&gt;, then an op is constructed that
performs the binary operation and assigns the result to the left argument.
Either way, if C&lt;optype&gt; is non-zero then C&lt;flags&gt; has no effect.

If C&lt;optype&gt; is zero, then a plain scalar or list assignment is
constructed.  Which type of assignment it is is automatically determined.
C&lt;flags&gt; gives the eight bits of C&lt;op_flags&gt;, except that C&lt;OPf_KIDS&gt;
will be set automatically, and, shifted up eight bits, the eight bits

Performs the fixup of the arguments part of an C&lt;entersub&gt; op tree
based on a subroutine prototype.  This makes various modifications to
the argument ops, from applying context up to inserting C&lt;refgen&gt; ops,
and checking the number and syntactic types of arguments, as directed by
the prototype.  This is the standard treatment used on a subroutine call,
not marked with C&lt;&amp;&gt;, where the callee can be identified at compile time
and has a prototype.

C&lt;protosv&gt; supplies the subroutine prototype to be applied to the call.
It may be a normal defined scalar, of which the string value will be used.
Alternatively, for convenience, it may be a subroutine object (a C&lt;CV*&gt;
that has been cast to C&lt;SV*&gt;) which has a prototype.  The prototype
supplied, in whichever form, does not need to match the actual callee
referenced by the op tree.

If the argument ops disagree with the prototype, for example by having
an unacceptable number of arguments, a valid op tree is returned anyway.
The error is reflected in the parser state, normally resulting in a single
exception at the top level of parsing which covers all the compilation
errors that occurred.  In the error message, the callee is referred to

at compile time as C&lt;cv&gt;.

The C-level function pointer is returned in C&lt;*ckfun_p&gt;, and an SV
argument for it is returned in C&lt;*ckobj_p&gt;.  The function is intended
to be called in this manner:

 entersubop = (*ckfun_p)(aTHX_ entersubop, namegv, (*ckobj_p));

In this call, C&lt;entersubop&gt; is a pointer to the C&lt;entersub&gt; op,
which may be replaced by the check function, and C&lt;namegv&gt; is a GV
supplying the name that should be used by the check function to refer
to the callee of the C&lt;entersub&gt; op if it needs to emit any diagnostics.
It is permitted to apply the check function in non-standard situations,
such as to a call to a different subroutine or to a method call.

By default, the function is
L&lt;Perl_ck_entersub_args_proto_or_list|/ck_entersub_args_proto_or_list&gt;,

=item cv_set_call_checker_flags
X&lt;cv_set_call_checker_flags&gt;

Sets the function that will be used to fix up a call to C&lt;cv&gt;.
Specifically, the function is applied to an C&lt;entersub&gt; op tree for a
subroutine call, not marked with C&lt;&amp;&gt;, where the callee can be identified
at compile time as C&lt;cv&gt;.

The C-level function pointer is supplied in C&lt;ckfun&gt;, and an SV argument
for it is supplied in C&lt;ckobj&gt;.  The function should be defined like this:

    STATIC OP * ckfun(pTHX_ OP *op, GV *namegv, SV *ckobj)

It is intended to be called in this manner:

    entersubop = ckfun(aTHX_ entersubop, namegv, ckobj);

In this call, C&lt;entersubop&gt; is a pointer to the C&lt;entersub&gt; op,
which may be replaced by the check function, and C&lt;namegv&gt; supplies
the name that should be used by the check function to refer
to the callee of the C&lt;entersub&gt; op if it needs to emit any diagnostics.
It is permitted to apply the check function in non-standard situations,
such as to a call to a different subroutine or to a method call.

C&lt;namegv&gt; may not actually be a GV.  For efficiency, perl may pass a
CV or other SV instead.  Whatever is passed can be used as the first
argument to L&lt;/cv_name&gt;.  You can force perl to pass a GV by including
C&lt;CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV&gt; in the C&lt;flags&gt;.

The current setting for a particular CV can be retrieved by
L&lt;/cv_get_call_checker&gt;.

Creates a constant sub equivalent to Perl S&lt;C&lt;sub FOO () { 123 }&gt;&gt; which is

Currently, the only useful value for C&lt;flags&gt; is C&lt;SVf_UTF8&gt;.

The newly created subroutine takes ownership of a reference to the passed in
SV.

Passing C&lt;NULL&gt; for SV creates a constant sub equivalent to S&lt;C&lt;sub BAR () {}&gt;&gt;,
which won&#39;t be called if used as a destructor, but will suppress the overhead
of a call to C&lt;AUTOLOAD&gt;.  (This form, however, isn&#39;t eligible for inlining at

and C&lt;last&gt; is the op to append to the list.  C&lt;optype&gt; specifies the
intended opcode for the list.  If C&lt;first&gt; is not already a list of the

A list-type op is usually constructed one kid at a time via C&lt;newLISTOP&gt;,

Propagate lvalue (&quot;modifiable&quot;) context to an op and its children.
C&lt;type&gt; represents the context type, roughly based on the type of op that
would do the modifying, although C&lt;local()&gt; is represented by C&lt;OP_NULL&gt;,
because it has no op type of its own (it is signalled by a flag on
the lvalue op).

This function detects things that can&#39;t be modified, such as C&lt;$x+1&gt;, and
generates errors for them.  For example, C&lt;$x+1 = 2&gt; would cause it to be
called with an op of type C&lt;OP_ADD&gt; and a C&lt;type&gt; argument of C&lt;OP_SASSIGN&gt;.

It also flags things that need to behave specially in an lvalue context,

=item op_sibling_splice
X&lt;op_sibling_splice&gt;

A general function for editing the structure of an existing chain of
op_sibling nodes.  By analogy with the perl-level C&lt;splice()&gt; function, allows
you to delete zero or more sequential nodes, replacing them with zero or
more different nodes.  Performs the necessary op_first/op_last
housekeeping on the parent node and op_sibling manipulation on the
children.  The last deleted node will be marked as as the last node by
updating the op_sibling/op_sibparent or op_moresib field as appropriate.

Note that op_next is not manipulated, and nodes are not freed; that is the
responsibility of the caller.  It also won&#39;t create a new list op for an
empty list etc; use higher-level functions like op_append_elem() for that.

C&lt;parent&gt; is the parent node of the sibling chain. It may passed as C&lt;NULL&gt; if
the splicing doesn&#39;t affect the first or last op in the chain.

C&lt;start&gt; is the node preceding the first node to be spliced.  Node(s)
following it will be deleted, and ops will be inserted after it.  If it is
C&lt;NULL&gt;, the first node onwards is deleted, and nodes are inserted at the
beginning.

C&lt;del_count&gt; is the number of nodes to delete.  If zero, no nodes are deleted.
If -1 or greater than or equal to the number of remaining kids, all
remaining kids are deleted.

C&lt;insert&gt; is the first of a chain of nodes to be inserted in place of the nodes.
If C&lt;NULL&gt;, no nodes are inserted.

The head of the chain of deleted ops is returned, or C&lt;NULL&gt; if no ops were
deleted.

For example:

    action                    before      after         returns

=item rv2cv_op_cv
X&lt;rv2cv_op_cv&gt;

Examines an op, which is expected to identify a subroutine at runtime,
and attempts to determine at compile time which subroutine it identifies.
This is normally used during Perl compilation to determine whether
a prototype can be applied to a function call.  C&lt;cvop&gt; is the op
being considered, normally an C&lt;rv2cv&gt; op.  A pointer to the identified
subroutine is returned, if it could be determined statically, and a null
pointer is returned if it was not possible to determine statically.

Currently, the subroutine can be identified statically if the RV that the
C&lt;rv2cv&gt; is to operate on is provided by a suitable C&lt;gv&gt; or C&lt;const&gt; op.
A C&lt;gv&gt; op is suitable if the GV&#39;s CV slot is populated.  A C&lt;const&gt; op is
suitable if the constant value must be an RV pointing to a CV.  Details of
this process may change in future versions of Perl.  If the C&lt;rv2cv&gt; op
has the C&lt;OPpENTERSUB_AMPER&gt; flag set then no attempt is made to identify
the subroutine statically: this flag is used to suppress compile-time
magic on a subroutine call, forcing it to use default runtime behaviour.

If C&lt;flags&gt; has the bit C&lt;RV2CVOPCV_MARK_EARLY&gt; set, then the handling
of a GV reference is modified.  If a GV was examined and its CV slot was
found to be empty, then the C&lt;gv&gt; op has the C&lt;OPpEARLY_CV&gt; flag set.
If the op is not optimised away, and the CV slot is later populated with
a subroutine having a prototype, that flag eventually triggers the warning
&quot;called too early to check prototype&quot;.

If C&lt;flags&gt; has the bit C&lt;RV2CVOPCV_RETURN_NAME_GV&gt; set, then instead
of returning a pointer to the subroutine it returns a pointer to the
GV giving the most appropriate name for the subroutine in this context.
Normally this is just the C&lt;CvGV&gt; of the subroutine, but for an anonymous
(C&lt;CvANON&gt;) subroutine that is referenced through a GV it will be the
referencing GV.  The resulting C&lt;GV*&gt; is cast to C&lt;CV*&gt; to be returned.
A null pointer is returned as usual if there is no statically-determinable
subroutine.

=item CvPADLIST
X&lt;CvPADLIST&gt;


NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.


CV&#39;s can have CvPADLIST(cv) set to point to a PADLIST.  This is the CV&#39;s
scratchpad, which stores lexical variables and opcode temporary and
per-thread values.

For these purposes &quot;formats&quot; are a kind-of CV; eval&quot;&quot;s are too (except they&#39;re
not callable at will and are always thrown away after the eval&quot;&quot; is done
executing).  Require&#39;d files are simply evals without any outer lexical
scope.

XSUBs do not have a C&lt;CvPADLIST&gt;.  C&lt;dXSTARG&gt; fetches values from C&lt;PL_curpad&gt;,
but that is really the callers pad (a slot of which is allocated by
every entersub). Do not get or set C&lt;CvPADLIST&gt; if a CV is an XSUB (as
determined by C&lt;CvISXSUB()&gt;), C&lt;CvPADLIST&gt; slot is reused for a different
internal purpose in XSUBs.

The PADLIST has a C array where pads are stored.

The 0th entry of the PADLIST is a PADNAMELIST
which represents the &quot;names&quot; or rather
the &quot;static type information&quot; for lexicals.  The individual elements of a
PADNAMELIST are PADNAMEs.  Future
refactorings might stop the PADNAMELIST from being stored in the PADLIST&#39;s
array, so don&#39;t rely on it.  See L&lt;/PadlistNAMES&gt;.

The CvDEPTH&#39;th entry of a PADLIST is a PAD (an AV) which is the stack frame
at that depth of recursion into the CV.  The 0th slot of a frame AV is an
AV which is C&lt;@_&gt;.  Other entries are storage for variables and op targets.

Iterating over the PADNAMELIST iterates over all possible pad
items.  Pad slots for targets (C&lt;SVs_PADTMP&gt;)
and GVs end up having &amp;PL_padname_undef &quot;names&quot;, while slots for constants 
have C&lt;&amp;PL_padname_const&gt; &quot;names&quot; (see C&lt;L&lt;/pad_alloc&gt;&gt;).  That
C&lt;&amp;PL_padname_undef&gt;
and C&lt;&amp;PL_padname_const&gt; are used is an implementation detail subject to
change.  To test for them, use C&lt;!PadnamePV(name)&gt; and
S&lt;C&lt;PadnamePV(name) &amp;&amp; !PadnameLEN(name)&gt;&gt;, respectively.

Only C&lt;my&gt;/C&lt;our&gt; variable slots get valid names.
The rest are op targets/GVs/constants which are statically allocated
or resolved at compile time.  These don&#39;t have names by which they
can be looked up from Perl code at run time through eval&quot;&quot; the way
C&lt;my&gt;/C&lt;our&gt; variables can be.  Since they can&#39;t be looked up by &quot;name&quot;
but only by their index allocated at compile time (which is usually
in C&lt;PL_op-&gt;op_targ&gt;), wasting a name SV for them doesn&#39;t make sense.

The pad names in the PADNAMELIST have their PV holding the name of
the variable.  The C&lt;COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW&gt; and C&lt;_HIGH&gt; fields form a range
(low+1..high inclusive) of cop_seq numbers for which the name is
valid.  During compilation, these fields may hold the special value
PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO to indicate various stages:

 COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW        _HIGH
 -----------------        -----
 PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO            0   variable not yet introduced:
                                  { my ($x
 valid-seq#   PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO   variable in scope:
                                  { my ($x);
 valid-seq#          valid-seq#   compilation of scope complete:
                                  { my ($x); .... }

When a lexical var hasn&#39;t yet been introduced, it already exists from the
perspective of duplicate declarations, but not for variable lookups, e.g.

    my ($x, $x); # &#39;&quot;my&quot; variable $x masks earlier declaration&#39;
    my $x = $x;  # equal to my $x = $::x;

For typed lexicals C&lt;PadnameTYPE&gt; points at the type stash.  For C&lt;our&gt;
lexicals, C&lt;PadnameOURSTASH&gt; points at the stash of the associated global (so
that duplicate C&lt;our&gt; declarations in the same package can be detected).
C&lt;PadnameGEN&gt; is sometimes used to store the generation number during
compilation.

If C&lt;PadnameOUTER&gt; is set on the pad name, then that slot in the frame AV
is a REFCNT&#39;ed reference to a lexical from &quot;outside&quot;.  Such entries
are sometimes referred to as &#39;fake&#39;.  In this case, the name does not
use &#39;low&#39; and &#39;high&#39; to store a cop_seq range, since it is in scope
throughout.  Instead &#39;high&#39; stores some flags containing info about
the real lexical (is it declared in an anon, and is it capable of being
instantiated multiple times?), and for fake ANONs, &#39;low&#39; contains the index
within the parent&#39;s pad where the lexical&#39;s value is stored, to make
cloning quicker.

If the &#39;name&#39; is C&lt;&amp;&gt; the corresponding entry in the PAD
is a CV representing a possible closure.

Note that formats are treated as anon subs, and are cloned each time
write is called (if necessary).

The flag C&lt;SVs_PADSTALE&gt; is cleared on lexicals each time the C&lt;my()&gt; is executed,
and set on scope exit.  This allows the
C&lt;&quot;Variable $x is not available&quot;&gt; warning
to be generated in evals, such as 

    { my $x = 1; sub f { eval &#39;$x&#39;} } f();

For state vars, C&lt;SVs_PADSTALE&gt; is overloaded to mean &#39;not yet initialised&#39;,
but this internal state is stored in a separate pad entry.

=head1 Per-Interpreter Variables

=over 8

=item PL_modglobal
X&lt;PL_modglobal&gt;

C&lt;PL_modglobal&gt; is a general purpose, interpreter global HV for use by
extensions that need to keep information on a per-interpreter basis.
In a pinch, it can also be used as a symbol table for extensions
to share data among each other.  It is a good idea to use keys
prefixed by the package name of the extension that owns the data.

	HV*	PL_modglobal

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_na
X&lt;PL_na&gt;

A convenience variable which is typically used with C&lt;SvPV&gt; when one
doesn&#39;t care about the length of the string.  It is usually more efficient
to either declare a local variable and use that instead or to use the
C&lt;SvPV_nolen&gt; macro.

=item PL_opfreehook
X&lt;PL_opfreehook&gt;

When non-C&lt;NULL&gt;, the function pointed by this variable will be called each time an OP is freed with the corresponding OP as the argument.
This allows extensions to free any extra attribute they have locally attached to an OP.
It is also assured to first fire for the parent OP and then for its kids.

When you replace this variable, it is considered a good practice to store the possibly previously installed hook and that you recall it inside your own.

	Perl_ophook_t	PL_opfreehook

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_peepp
X&lt;PL_peepp&gt;

Pointer to the per-subroutine peephole optimiser.  This is a function
that gets called at the end of compilation of a Perl subroutine (or
equivalently independent piece of Perl code) to perform fixups of
some ops and to perform small-scale optimisations.  The function is
called once for each subroutine that is compiled, and is passed, as sole
parameter, a pointer to the op that is the entry point to the subroutine.
It modifies the op tree in place.

The peephole optimiser should never be completely replaced.  Rather,
add code to it by wrapping the existing optimiser.  The basic way to do
this can be seen in L&lt;perlguts/Compile pass 3: peephole optimization&gt;.
If the new code wishes to operate on ops throughout the subroutine&#39;s
structure, rather than just at the top level, it is likely to be more
convenient to wrap the L&lt;/PL_rpeepp&gt; hook.

	peep_t	PL_peepp

=for hackers
Found in file intrpvar.h

=item PL_rpeepp
X&lt;PL_rpeepp&gt;

Pointer to the recursive peephole optimiser.  This is a function
that gets called at the end of compilation of a Perl subroutine (or
equivalently independent piece of Perl code) to perform fixups of some
ops and to perform small-scale optimisations.  The function is called
once for each chain of ops linked through their C&lt;op_next&gt; fields;
it is recursively called to handle each side chain.  It is passed, as
sole parameter, a pointer to the op that is at the head of the chain.
It modifies the op tree in place.

The peephole optimiser should never be completely replaced.  Rather,
add code to it by wrapping the existing optimiser.  The basic way to do
this can be seen in L&lt;perlguts/Compile pass 3: peephole optimization&gt;.
If the new code wishes to operate only on ops at a subroutine&#39;s top level,
rather than throughout the structure, it is likely to be more convenient
to wrap the L&lt;/PL_peepp&gt; hook.

=item newSV
X&lt;newSV&gt;

Creates a new SV.  A non-zero C&lt;len&gt; parameter indicates the number of
bytes of preallocated string space the SV should have.  An extra byte for a
trailing C&lt;NUL&gt; is also reserved.  (C&lt;SvPOK&gt; is not set for the SV even if string
space is allocated.)  The reference count for the new SV is set to 1.

In 5.9.3, C&lt;newSV()&gt; replaces the older C&lt;NEWSV()&gt; API, and drops the first
parameter, I&lt;x&gt;, a debug aid which allowed callers to identify themselves.
This aid has been superseded by a new build option, C&lt;PERL_MEM_LOG&gt; (see
L&lt;perlhacktips/PERL_MEM_LOG&gt;).  The older API is still there for use in XS
modules supporting older perls.

=item newSVpv
X&lt;newSVpv&gt;

Creates a new SV and copies a string (which may contain C&lt;NUL&gt; (C&lt;\0&gt;)
characters) into it.  The reference count for the
SV is set to 1.  If C&lt;len&gt; is zero, Perl will compute the length using
C&lt;strlen()&gt;, (which means if you use this option, that C&lt;s&gt; can&#39;t have embedded
C&lt;NUL&gt; characters and has to have a terminating C&lt;NUL&gt; byte).

This function can cause reliability issues if you are likely to pass in
empty strings that are not null terminated, because it will run
strlen on the string and potentially run past valid memory.

Using L&lt;/newSVpvn&gt; is a safer alternative for non C&lt;NUL&gt; terminated strings.
For string literals use L&lt;/newSVpvs&gt; instead.  This function will work fine for
C&lt;NUL&gt; terminated strings, but if you want to avoid the if statement on whether
to call C&lt;strlen&gt; use C&lt;newSVpvn&gt; instead (calling C&lt;strlen&gt; yourself).

Creates a new SV and copies a string into it, which may contain C&lt;NUL&gt; characters
(C&lt;\0&gt;) and other binary data.  The reference count for the SV is set to 1.
Note that if C&lt;len&gt; is zero, Perl will create a zero length (Perl) string.  You
are responsible for ensuring that the source buffer is at least
C&lt;len&gt; bytes long.  If the C&lt;buffer&gt; argument is NULL the new SV will be
undefined.

	SV*	newSVpvn(const char *const s, const STRLEN len)

=item newSVpvn_flags
X&lt;newSVpvn_flags&gt;

Creates a new SV and copies a string (which may contain C&lt;NUL&gt; (C&lt;\0&gt;)
characters) into it.  The reference count for the
SV is set to 1.  Note that if C&lt;len&gt; is zero, Perl will create a zero length
string.  You are responsible for ensuring that the source string is at least
C&lt;len&gt; bytes long.  If the C&lt;s&gt; argument is NULL the new SV will be undefined.
Currently the only flag bits accepted are C&lt;SVf_UTF8&gt; and C&lt;SVs_TEMP&gt;.
If C&lt;SVs_TEMP&gt; is set, then C&lt;sv_2mortal()&gt; is called on the result before
returning.  If C&lt;SVf_UTF8&gt; is set, C&lt;s&gt;
is considered to be in UTF-8 and the
C&lt;SVf_UTF8&gt; flag will be set on the new SV.
C&lt;newSVpvn_utf8()&gt; is a convenience wrapper for this function, defined as

    #define newSVpvn_utf8(s, len, u)			\
	newSVpvn_flags((s), (len), (u) ? SVf_UTF8 : 0)

=item newSVpvn_share
X&lt;newSVpvn_share&gt;

Creates a new SV with its C&lt;SvPVX_const&gt; pointing to a shared string in the string
table.  If the string does not already exist in the table, it is
created first.  Turns on the C&lt;SvIsCOW&gt; flag (or C&lt;READONLY&gt;
and C&lt;FAKE&gt; in 5.16 and earlier).  If the C&lt;hash&gt; parameter
is non-zero, that value is used; otherwise the hash is computed.
The string&#39;s hash can later be retrieved from the SV
with the C&lt;SvSHARED_HASH()&gt; macro.  The idea here is
that as the string table is used for shared hash keys these strings will have
C&lt;SvPVX_const == HeKEY&gt; and hash lookup will avoid string compare.

Beware: after this function returns, C&lt;ptr&gt; and SvPVX_const(sv) may no longer
refer to the same chunk of data.

The unfortunate similarity of this function&#39;s name to that of Perl&#39;s C&lt;chop&gt;

Undo various types of fakery on an SV, where fakery means

a private copy; if we&#39;re a ref, stop refing; if we&#39;re a glob, downgrade to
an C&lt;xpvmg&gt;; if we&#39;re a copy-on-write scalar, this is the on-write time when
we do the copy, and is also used locally; if this is a
vstring, drop the vstring magic.  If C&lt;SV_COW_DROP_PV&gt; is set
then a copy-on-write scalar drops its PV buffer (if any) and becomes
C&lt;SvPOK_off&gt; rather than making a copy.  (Used where this
scalar is about to be set to some other value.)  In addition,
the C&lt;flags&gt; parameter gets passed to C&lt;sv_unref_flags()&gt;
when unreffing.  C&lt;sv_force_normal&gt; calls this function
with flags set to 0.

This function is expected to be used to signal to perl that this SV is
about to be written to, and any extra book-keeping needs to be taken care

Get a sensible string out of the SV somehow.
If C&lt;flags&gt; has the C&lt;SV_GMAGIC&gt; bit set, will C&lt;mg_get&gt; on C&lt;sv&gt; if
appropriate, else not.  C&lt;sv_pvn_force&gt; and C&lt;sv_pvn_force_nomg&gt; are

Returns a SV describing what the SV passed in is a reference to.

dst can be a SV to be set to the description or NULL, in which case a

=item sv_replace
X&lt;sv_replace&gt;

Make the first argument a copy of the second, then delete the original.
The target SV physically takes over ownership of the body of the source SV
and inherits its flags; however, the target keeps any magic it owns,
and any magic in the source is discarded.
Note that this is a rather specialist SV copying operation; most of the
time you&#39;ll want to use C&lt;sv_setsv&gt; or one of its many macro front-ends.

X&lt;sv_usepvn_flags&gt;

Tells an SV to use C&lt;ptr&gt; to find its string value.  Normally the
string is stored inside the SV, but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an
outside string.  C&lt;ptr&gt; should point to memory that was allocated
by L&lt;C&lt;Newx&gt;|perlclib/Memory Management and String Handling&gt;.  It must be
the start of a C&lt;Newx&gt;-ed block of memory, and not a pointer to the
middle of it (beware of L&lt;C&lt;OOK&gt;|perlguts/Offsets&gt; and copy-on-write),
and not be from a non-C&lt;Newx&gt; memory allocator like C&lt;malloc&gt;.  The
string length, C&lt;len&gt;, must be supplied.  By default this function
will C&lt;Renew&gt; (i.e. realloc, move) the memory pointed to by C&lt;ptr&gt;,
so that pointer should not be freed or used by the programmer after
giving it to C&lt;sv_usepvn&gt;, and neither should any pointers from &quot;behind&quot;
that pointer (e.g. ptr + 1) be used.

If S&lt;C&lt;flags &amp; SV_SMAGIC&gt;&gt; is true, will call C&lt;SvSETMAGIC&gt;.  If
S&lt;C&lt;flags&gt; &amp; SV_HAS_TRAILING_NUL&gt;&gt; is true, then C&lt;ptr[len]&gt; must be C&lt;NUL&gt;,
and the realloc
will be skipped (i.e. the buffer is actually at least 1 byte longer than

will C&lt;mg_get&gt; on C&lt;sv&gt; if appropriate, else not.

If C&lt;flags&gt; has C&lt;SV_FORCE_UTF8_UPGRADE&gt; set, this function assumes that the PV
will expand when converted to UTF-8, and skips the extra work of checking for
that.  Typically this flag is used by a routine that has already parsed the

=item sv_vcatpvfn_flags
X&lt;sv_vcatpvfn_flags&gt;

Processes its arguments like C&lt;vsprintf&gt; and appends the formatted output
to an SV.  Uses an array of SVs if the C-style variable argument list is
missing (C&lt;NULL&gt;). Argument reordering (using format specifiers like C&lt;%2$d&gt;
or C&lt;%*2$d&gt;) is supported only when using an array of SVs; using a C-style
C&lt;va_list&gt; argument list with a format string that uses argument reordering
will yield an exception.

When running with taint checks enabled, indicates via
C&lt;maybe_tainted&gt; if results are untrustworthy (often due to the use of
locales).

If called as C&lt;sv_vcatpvfn&gt; or flags has the C&lt;SV_GMAGIC&gt; bit set, calls get magic.

=item svtype
X&lt;svtype&gt;

An enum of flags for Perl types.  These are found in the file F&lt;sv.h&gt;
in the C&lt;svtype&gt; enum.  Test these flags with the C&lt;SvTYPE&gt; macro.

The types are:

    SVt_NULL
    SVt_IV
    SVt_NV
    SVt_RV
    SVt_PV
    SVt_PVIV
    SVt_PVNV
    SVt_PVMG
    SVt_INVLIST
    SVt_REGEXP
    SVt_PVGV
    SVt_PVLV
    SVt_PVAV
    SVt_PVHV
    SVt_PVCV
    SVt_PVFM
    SVt_PVIO

These are most easily explained from the bottom up.

C&lt;SVt_PVIO&gt; is for I/O objects, C&lt;SVt_PVFM&gt; for formats, C&lt;SVt_PVCV&gt; for
subroutines, C&lt;SVt_PVHV&gt; for hashes and C&lt;SVt_PVAV&gt; for arrays.

All the others are scalar types, that is, things that can be bound to a
C&lt;$&gt; variable.  For these, the internal types are mostly orthogonal to
types in the Perl language.

Hence, checking C&lt;&lt; SvTYPE(sv) &lt; SVt_PVAV &gt;&gt; is the best way to see whether
something is a scalar.

C&lt;SVt_PVGV&gt; represents a typeglob.  If C&lt;!SvFAKE(sv)&gt;, then it is a real,
incoercible typeglob.  If C&lt;SvFAKE(sv)&gt;, then it is a scalar to which a
typeglob has been assigned.  Assigning to it again will stop it from being
a typeglob.  C&lt;SVt_PVLV&gt; represents a scalar that delegates to another scalar
behind the scenes.  It is used, e.g., for the return value of C&lt;substr&gt; and
for tied hash and array elements.  It can hold any scalar value, including
a typeglob.  C&lt;SVt_REGEXP&gt; is for regular
expressions.  C&lt;SVt_INVLIST&gt; is for Perl
core internal use only.

C&lt;SVt_PVMG&gt; represents a &quot;normal&quot; scalar (not a typeglob, regular expression,
or delegate).  Since most scalars do not need all the internal fields of a
PVMG, we save memory by allocating smaller structs when possible.  All the
other types are just simpler forms of C&lt;SVt_PVMG&gt;, with fewer internal fields.
C&lt;SVt_NULL&gt; can only hold undef.  C&lt;SVt_IV&gt; can hold undef, an integer, or a
reference.  (C&lt;SVt_RV&gt; is an alias for C&lt;SVt_IV&gt;, which exists for backward
compatibility.)  C&lt;SVt_NV&gt; can hold any of those or a double.  C&lt;SVt_PV&gt; can only
hold C&lt;undef&gt; or a string.  C&lt;SVt_PVIV&gt; is a superset of C&lt;SVt_PV&gt; and C&lt;SVt_IV&gt;.
C&lt;SVt_PVNV&gt; is similar.  C&lt;SVt_PVMG&gt; can hold anything C&lt;SVt_PVNV&gt; can hold, but it
can, but does not have to, be blessed or magical.

=item SvOOK
X&lt;SvOOK&gt;

Returns a U32 indicating whether the pointer to the string buffer is offset.
This hack is used internally to speed up removal of characters from the
beginning of a C&lt;SvPV&gt;.  When C&lt;SvOOK&gt; is true, then the start of the
allocated string buffer is actually C&lt;SvOOK_offset()&gt; bytes before C&lt;SvPVX&gt;.
This offset used to be stored in C&lt;SvIVX&gt;, but is now stored within the spare
part of the buffer.

	U32	SvOOK(SV* sv)

allocated buffer, which will be non-zero if C&lt;sv_chop&gt; has been used to
efficiently remove characters from start of the buffer.  Implemented as a
macro, which takes the address of C&lt;len&gt;, which must be of type C&lt;STRLEN&gt;.
Evaluates C&lt;sv&gt; more than once.  Sets C&lt;len&gt; to 0 if C&lt;SvOOK(sv)&gt; is false.

=item SvPV
X&lt;SvPV&gt;

Returns a pointer to the string in the SV, or a stringified form of
the SV if the SV does not contain a string.  The SV may cache the
stringified version becoming C&lt;SvPOK&gt;.  Handles &#39;get&#39; magic.  The
C&lt;len&gt; variable will be set to the length of the string (this is a macro, so
don&#39;t use C&lt;&amp;len&gt;).  See also C&lt;L&lt;/SvPVx&gt;&gt; for a version which guarantees to
evaluate C&lt;sv&gt; only once.

Note that there is no guarantee that the return value of C&lt;SvPV()&gt; is
equal to C&lt;SvPVX(sv)&gt;, or that C&lt;SvPVX(sv)&gt; contains valid data, or that
successive calls to C&lt;SvPV(sv)&gt; will return the same pointer value each
time.  This is due to the way that things like overloading and
Copy-On-Write are handled.  In these cases, the return value may point to
a temporary buffer or similar.  If you absolutely need the C&lt;SvPVX&gt; field to
be valid (for example, if you intend to write to it), then see
C&lt;L&lt;/SvPV_force&gt;&gt;.

going to update the C&lt;SvPVX&gt; directly.  Processes get magic.

Note that coercing an arbitrary scalar into a plain PV will potentially
strip useful data from it.  For example if the SV was C&lt;SvROK&gt;, then the
referent will have its reference count decremented, and the SV itself may
be converted to an C&lt;SvPOK&gt; scalar with a string buffer containing a value
such as C&lt;&quot;ARRAY(0x1234)&quot;&gt;.

=item BOM_UTF8
X&lt;BOM_UTF8&gt;

This is a macro that evaluates to a string constant of the  UTF-8 bytes that
define the Unicode BYTE ORDER MARK (U+FEFF) for the platform that perl
is compiled on.  This allows code to use a mnemonic for this character that
works on both ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.
S&lt;C&lt;sizeof(BOM_UTF8) - 1&gt;&gt; can be used to get its length in
bytes.

Compares the sequence of characters (stored as octets) in C&lt;b&gt;, C&lt;blen&gt; with the
sequence of characters (stored as UTF-8)
in C&lt;u&gt;, C&lt;ulen&gt;.  Returns 0 if they are
equal, -1 or -2 if the first string is less than the second string, +1 or +2
if the first string is greater than the second string.

-1 or +1 is returned if the shorter string was identical to the start of the
longer string.  -2 or +2 is returned if
there was a difference between characters
within the strings.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

Converts a string C&lt;s&gt; of length C&lt;len&gt; from UTF-8 into native byte encoding.
Unlike L&lt;/utf8_to_bytes&gt; but like L&lt;/bytes_to_utf8&gt;, returns a pointer to
the newly-created string, and updates C&lt;len&gt; to contain the new
length.  Returns the original string if no conversion occurs, C&lt;len&gt;
is unchanged.  Do nothing if C&lt;is_utf8&gt; points to 0.  Sets C&lt;is_utf8&gt; to
0 if C&lt;s&gt; is converted or consisted entirely of characters that are invariant
in UTF-8 (i.e., US-ASCII on non-EBCDIC machines).

Converts a string C&lt;s&gt; of length C&lt;len&gt; bytes from the native encoding into
UTF-8.
Returns a pointer to the newly-created string, and sets C&lt;len&gt; to
reflect the new length in bytes.

A C&lt;NUL&gt; character will be written after the end of the string.

If you want to convert to UTF-8 from encodings other than
the native (Latin1 or EBCDIC),

You should use this I&lt;after&gt; a call to C&lt;SvPV()&gt; or one of its variants, in

=item foldEQ_utf8
X&lt;foldEQ_utf8&gt;

Returns true if the leading portions of the strings C&lt;s1&gt; and C&lt;s2&gt; (either or both
of which may be in UTF-8) are the same case-insensitively; false otherwise.
How far into the strings to compare is determined by other input parameters.

If C&lt;u1&gt; is true, the string C&lt;s1&gt; is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode;
otherwise it is assumed to be in native 8-bit encoding.  Correspondingly for C&lt;u2&gt;
with respect to C&lt;s2&gt;.

If the byte length C&lt;l1&gt; is non-zero, it says how far into C&lt;s1&gt; to check for fold
equality.  In other words, C&lt;s1&gt;+C&lt;l1&gt; will be used as a goal to reach.  The
scan will not be considered to be a match unless the goal is reached, and
scanning won&#39;t continue past that goal.  Correspondingly for C&lt;l2&gt; with respect to
C&lt;s2&gt;.

If C&lt;pe1&gt; is non-C&lt;NULL&gt; and the pointer it points to is not C&lt;NULL&gt;, that pointer is
considered an end pointer to the position 1 byte past the maximum point
in C&lt;s1&gt; beyond which scanning will not continue under any circumstances.
(This routine assumes that UTF-8 encoded input strings are not malformed;
malformed input can cause it to read past C&lt;pe1&gt;).
This means that if both C&lt;l1&gt; and C&lt;pe1&gt; are specified, and C&lt;pe1&gt;
is less than C&lt;s1&gt;+C&lt;l1&gt;, the match will never be successful because it can
never
get as far as its goal (and in fact is asserted against).  Correspondingly for
C&lt;pe2&gt; with respect to C&lt;s2&gt;.

At least one of C&lt;s1&gt; and C&lt;s2&gt; must have a goal (at least one of C&lt;l1&gt; and
C&lt;l2&gt; must be non-zero), and if both do, both have to be
reached for a successful match.   Also, if the fold of a character is multiple
characters, all of them must be matched (see tr21 reference below for
&#39;folding&#39;).

Upon a successful match, if C&lt;pe1&gt; is non-C&lt;NULL&gt;,
it will be set to point to the beginning of the I&lt;next&gt; character of C&lt;s1&gt;
beyond what was matched.  Correspondingly for C&lt;pe2&gt; and C&lt;s2&gt;.

For case-insensitiveness, the &quot;casefolding&quot; of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see
L&lt;http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/&gt; (Case Mappings).

Returns TRUE if the first C&lt;len&gt; bytes of string C&lt;s&gt; form a valid
Perl-extended-UTF-8 string; returns FALSE otherwise.  If C&lt;len&gt; is 0, it will
be calculated using C&lt;strlen(s)&gt; (which means if you use this option, that C&lt;s&gt;
can&#39;t have embedded C&lt;NUL&gt; characters and has to have a terminating C&lt;NUL&gt;
byte).  Note that all characters being ASCII constitute &#39;a valid UTF-8 string&#39;.

This function considers Perl&#39;s extended UTF-8 to be valid.  That means that
code points above Unicode, surrogates, and non-character code points are
considered valid by this function.  Use C&lt;L&lt;/is_strict_utf8_string&gt;&gt;,

X&lt;is_utf8_valid_partial_char&gt;

Returns 0 if the sequence of bytes starting at C&lt;s&gt; and looking no further than
S&lt;C&lt;e - 1&gt;&gt; is the UTF-8 encoding, as extended by Perl, for one or more code
points.  Otherwise, it returns 1 if there exists at least one non-empty
sequence of bytes that when appended to sequence C&lt;s&gt;, starting at position
C&lt;e&gt; causes the entire sequence to be the well-formed UTF-8 of some code point;
otherwise returns 0.

In other words this returns TRUE if C&lt;s&gt; points to a partial UTF-8-encoded code
point.

This is useful when a fixed-length buffer is being tested for being well-formed
UTF-8, but the final few bytes in it don&#39;t comprise a full character; that is,
it is split somewhere in the middle of the final code point&#39;s UTF-8
representation.  (Presumably when the buffer is refreshed with the next chunk
of data, the new first bytes will complete the partial code point.)   This
function is used to verify that the final bytes in the current buffer are in
fact the legal beginning of some code point, so that if they aren&#39;t, the
failure can be signalled without having to wait for the next read.

or not the input is a valid UTF-8 encoded partial character, but it takes an

If C&lt;flags&gt; is 0, this behaves identically to

there is any sequence of bytes that can complete the input partial character in
such a way that a non-prohibited character is formed, the function returns
TRUE; otherwise FALSE.  Non character code points cannot be determined based on
partial character input.  But many  of the other possible excluded types can be
determined from just the first one or two bytes.

Evaluates to non-zero if the first few bytes of the string starting at C&lt;s&gt; and
looking no further than S&lt;C&lt;e - 1&gt;&gt; are well-formed UTF-8, as extended by Perl,
that represents some code point; otherwise it evaluates to 0.  If non-zero, the
value gives how many bytes starting at C&lt;s&gt; comprise the code point&#39;s
representation.  Any bytes remaining before C&lt;e&gt;, but beyond the ones needed to
form the first code point in C&lt;s&gt;, are not examined.

The code point can be any that will fit in a UV on this machine, using Perl&#39;s
extension to official UTF-8 to represent those higher than the Unicode maximum
of 0x10FFFF.  That means that this macro is used to efficiently decide if the
next few bytes in C&lt;s&gt; is legal UTF-8 for a single character.

defined by Unicode to be fully interchangeable across applications;

Note that it is deprecated to use code points higher than what will fit in an
IV.  This macro does not raise any warnings for such code points, treating them
as valid.

Note also that a UTF-8 INVARIANT character (i.e. ASCII on non-EBCDIC machines)
is a valid UTF-8 character.

Both the special and normal mappings are stored in F&lt;lib/unicore/To/Foo.pl&gt;,
and loaded by C&lt;SWASHNEW&gt;, using F&lt;lib/utf8_heavy.pl&gt;.  C&lt;special&gt; (usually,
but not always, a multicharacter mapping), is tried first.

C&lt;special&gt; is a string, normally C&lt;NULL&gt; or C&lt;&quot;&quot;&gt;.  C&lt;NULL&gt; means to not use
any special mappings; C&lt;&quot;&quot;&gt; means to use the special mappings.  Values other

=item utf8n_to_uvchr
X&lt;utf8n_to_uvchr&gt;

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L&lt;/utf8_to_uvchr_buf&gt;() rather than call this directly.

Bottom level UTF-8 decode routine.
Returns the native code point value of the first character in the string C&lt;s&gt;,
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) encoding, and no longer than
C&lt;curlen&gt; bytes; C&lt;*retlen&gt; (if C&lt;retlen&gt; isn&#39;t NULL) will be set to
the length, in bytes, of that character.

The value of C&lt;flags&gt; determines the behavior when C&lt;s&gt; does not point to a
well-formed UTF-8 character.  If C&lt;flags&gt; is 0, encountering a malformation
causes zero to be returned and C&lt;*retlen&gt; is set so that (S&lt;C&lt;s&gt; + C&lt;*retlen&gt;&gt;)
is the next possible position in C&lt;s&gt; that could begin a non-malformed
character.  Also, if UTF-8 warnings haven&#39;t been lexically disabled, a warning
is raised.  Some UTF-8 input sequences may contain multiple malformations.
This function tries to find every possible one in each call, so multiple
warnings can be raised for each sequence.

Various ALLOW flags can be set in C&lt;flags&gt; to allow (and not warn on)
individual types of malformations, such as the sequence being overlong (that
is, when there is a shorter sequence that can express the same code point;
overlong sequences are expressly forbidden in the UTF-8 standard due to
potential security issues).  Another malformation example is the first byte of
a character not being a legal first byte.  See F&lt;utf8.h&gt; for the list of such
flags.  Even if allowed, this function generally returns the Unicode
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER when it encounters a malformation.  There are flags in
F&lt;utf8.h&gt; to override this behavior for the overlong malformations, but don&#39;t
do that except for very specialized purposes.

The C&lt;UTF8_CHECK_ONLY&gt; flag overrides the behavior when a non-allowed (by other
flags) malformation is found.  If this flag is set, the routine assumes that
the caller will raise a warning, and this function will silently just set
C&lt;retlen&gt; to C&lt;-1&gt; (cast to C&lt;STRLEN&gt;) and return zero.

Note that this API requires disambiguation between successful decoding a C&lt;NUL&gt;
character, and an error return (unless the C&lt;UTF8_CHECK_ONLY&gt; flag is set), as
in both cases, 0 is returned, and, depending on the malformation, C&lt;retlen&gt; may
be set to 1.  To disambiguate, upon a zero return, see if the first byte of
C&lt;s&gt; is 0 as well.  If so, the input was a C&lt;NUL&gt;; if not, the input had an
error.  Or you can use C&lt;L&lt;/utf8n_to_uvchr_error&gt;&gt;.

Certain code points are considered problematic.  These are Unicode surrogates,
Unicode non-characters, and code points above the Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.
By default these are considered regular code points, but certain situations
warrant special handling for them, which can be specified using the C&lt;flags&gt;
parameter.  If C&lt;flags&gt; contains C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE&gt;, all
three classes are treated as malformations and handled as such.  The flags
C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE&gt;, C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR&gt;, and
C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER&gt; (meaning above the legal Unicode maximum) can be set to
disallow these categories individually.  C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE&gt;
restricts the allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by
Unicode.  Use C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE&gt; to use the strictness
definition given by
L&lt;Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html&gt;.
The difference between traditional strictness and C9 strictness is that the
latter does not forbid non-character code points.  (They are still discouraged,
however.)  For more discussion see L&lt;perlunicode/Noncharacter code points&gt;.

The flags C&lt;UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE&gt;,
C&lt;UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE&gt;, C&lt;UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE&gt;,
C&lt;UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR&gt;, and C&lt;UTF8_WARN_SUPER&gt; will cause warning messages to be
raised for their respective categories, but otherwise the code points are
considered valid (not malformations).  To get a category to both be treated as
a malformation and raise a warning, specify both the WARN and DISALLOW flags.
(But note that warnings are not raised if lexically disabled nor if
C&lt;UTF8_CHECK_ONLY&gt; is also specified.)

It is now deprecated to have very high code points (above C&lt;IV_MAX&gt; on the
platforms) and this function will raise a deprecation warning for these (unless
such warnings are turned off).  This value is typically 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 -1)
in a 32-bit word.

Code points above 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 - 1) were never specified in any standard,
so using them is more problematic than other above-Unicode code points.  Perl
invented an extension to UTF-8 to represent the ones above 2**36-1, so it is
likely that non-Perl languages will not be able to read files that contain
these; nor would Perl understand files
written by something that uses a different extension.  For these reasons, there
is a separate set of flags that can warn and/or disallow these extremely high
code points, even if other above-Unicode ones are accepted.  These are the
C&lt;UTF8_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; and C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; flags.  These
are entirely independent from the deprecation warning for code points above
C&lt;IV_MAX&gt;.  On 32-bit machines, it will eventually be forbidden to have any
code point that needs more than 31 bits to represent.  When that happens,
effectively the C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; flag will always be set on
32-bit machines.  (Of course C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER&gt; will treat all
above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations; and
C&lt;UTF8_WARN_SUPER&gt; warns on these.)

On EBCDIC platforms starting in Perl v5.24, the Perl extension for representing
extremely high code points kicks in at 0x3FFF_FFFF (2**30 -1), which is lower
than on ASCII.  Prior to that, code points 2**31 and higher were simply
unrepresentable, and a different, incompatible method was used to represent
code points between 2**30 and 2**31 - 1.  The flags C&lt;UTF8_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt;
and C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; have the same function as on ASCII
platforms, warning and disallowing 2**31 and higher.

All other code points corresponding to Unicode characters, including private
use and those yet to be assigned, are never considered malformed and never
warn.

=item utf8n_to_uvchr_error
X&lt;utf8n_to_uvchr_error&gt;

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L&lt;/utf8_to_uvchr_buf&gt;() rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found.

It is like C&lt;L&lt;/utf8n_to_uvchr&gt;&gt; but it takes an extra parameter placed after
all the others, C&lt;errors&gt;.  If this parameter is 0, this function behaves
identically to C&lt;L&lt;/utf8n_to_uvchr&gt;&gt;.  Otherwise, C&lt;errors&gt; should be a pointer
to a C&lt;U32&gt; variable, which this function sets to indicate any errors found.
Upon return, if C&lt;*errors&gt; is 0, there were no errors found.  Otherwise,
C&lt;*errors&gt; is the bit-wise C&lt;OR&gt; of the bits described in the list below.  Some
of these bits will be set if a malformation is found, even if the input
C&lt;flags&gt; parameter indicates that the given malformation is allowed; those
exceptions are noted:

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt;

The code point represented by the input UTF-8 sequence occupies more than 31
bits.
This bit is set only if the input C&lt;flags&gt; parameter contains either the
C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; or the C&lt;UTF8_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; flags.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that the first byte was a a UTF-8
continuation byte.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_EMPTY&gt;

The input C&lt;curlen&gt; parameter was 0.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_LONG&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that there is some other sequence that
evaluates to the same code point, but that sequence is shorter than this one.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_NONCHAR&gt;

The code point represented by the input UTF-8 sequence is for a Unicode
non-character code point.
This bit is set only if the input C&lt;flags&gt; parameter contains either the
C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR&gt; or the C&lt;UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR&gt; flags.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that a non-continuation type byte was found
in a position where only a continuation type one should be.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_OVERFLOW&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a code point that is not
representable in the number of bits available in a UV on the current platform.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_SHORT&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that C&lt;curlen&gt; is smaller than required for
a complete sequence.  In other words, the input is for a partial character
sequence.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_SUPER&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a non-Unicode code point;
that is, one above the legal Unicode maximum.
This bit is set only if the input C&lt;flags&gt; parameter contains either the
C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER&gt; or the C&lt;UTF8_WARN_SUPER&gt; flags.

=item C&lt;UTF8_GOT_SURROGATE&gt;

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a -Unicode UTF-16 surrogate
code point.
This bit is set only if the input C&lt;flags&gt; parameter contains either the
C&lt;UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE&gt; or the C&lt;UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE&gt; flags.

0 is returned if the bytes are not well-formed extended UTF-8, or if they
represent a code point that cannot fit in a UV on the current platform.  Hence
this macro can give different results when run on a 64-bit word machine than on
one with a 32-bit word size.

the byte after the end of the new character.  In other words,

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, flags);

or, in most cases,

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

This is the Unicode-aware way of saying

    *(d++) = uv;

If C&lt;flags&gt; is 0, this function accepts any UV as input, but very high code
points (above C&lt;IV_MAX&gt; for the platform)  will raise a deprecation warning.
This is typically 0x7FFF_FFFF in a 32-bit word.

Specifying C&lt;flags&gt; can further restrict what is allowed and not warned on, as
follows:

If C&lt;uv&gt; is a Unicode surrogate code point and C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_SURROGATE&gt; is set,
the function will raise a warning, provided UTF8 warnings are enabled.  If
instead C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_SURROGATE&gt; is set, the function will fail and return
NULL.  If both flags are set, the function will both warn and return NULL.

Similarly, the C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_NONCHAR&gt; and C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_NONCHAR&gt; flags
affect how the function handles a Unicode non-character.

And likewise, the C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_SUPER&gt; and C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER&gt; flags
affect the handling of code points that are above the Unicode maximum of
0x10FFFF.  Languages other than Perl may not be able to accept files that
contain these.

The flag C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE&gt; selects all three of
the above WARN flags; and C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE&gt; selects all
three DISALLOW flags.  C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE&gt; restricts the
allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by Unicode.
Similarly, C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE&gt; and
C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE&gt; are shortcuts to select the
above-Unicode and surrogate flags, but not the non-character ones, as
defined in
L&lt;Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html&gt;.
See L&lt;perlunicode/Noncharacter code points&gt;.

Code points above 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 - 1) were never specified in any standard,
so using them is more problematic than other above-Unicode code points.  Perl
invented an extension to UTF-8 to represent the ones above 2**36-1, so it is
likely that non-Perl languages will not be able to read files that contain
these that written by the perl interpreter; nor would Perl understand files
written by something that uses a different extension.  For these reasons, there
is a separate set of flags that can warn and/or disallow these extremely high
code points, even if other above-Unicode ones are accepted.  These are the
C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; and C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; flags.  These
are entirely independent from the deprecation warning for code points above
C&lt;IV_MAX&gt;.  On 32-bit machines, it will eventually be forbidden to have any
code point that needs more than 31 bits to represent.  When that happens,
effectively the C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; flag will always be set on
32-bit machines.  (Of course C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER&gt; will treat all
above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations; and
C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_SUPER&gt; warns on these.)

On EBCDIC platforms starting in Perl v5.24, the Perl extension for representing
extremely high code points kicks in at 0x3FFF_FFFF (2**30 -1), which is lower
than on ASCII.  Prior to that, code points 2**31 and higher were simply
unrepresentable, and a different, incompatible method was used to represent
code points between 2**30 and 2**31 - 1.  The flags C&lt;UNICODE_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt;
and C&lt;UNICODE_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT&gt; have the same function as on ASCII
platforms, warning and disallowing 2**31 and higher.

Instead you almost certainly want to use L&lt;/uvchr_to_utf8&gt; or
L&lt;/uvchr_to_utf8_flags&gt;.

This function is a deprecated synonym for L&lt;/uvoffuni_to_utf8_flags&gt;,
which itself, while not deprecated, should be used only in isolated
circumstances.  These functions were useful for code that wanted to handle
both EBCDIC and ASCII platforms with Unicode properties, but starting in Perl
v5.20, the distinctions between the platforms have mostly been made invisible
to most code, so this function is quite unlikely to be what you want.

=item croak
X&lt;croak&gt;

This is an XS interface to Perl&#39;s C&lt;die&gt; function.

Take a sprintf-style format pattern and argument list.  These are used to
generate a string message.  If the message does not end with a newline,
then it will be extended with some indication of the current location
in the code, as described for L&lt;/mess_sv&gt;.

The error message will be used as an exception, by default
returning control to the nearest enclosing C&lt;eval&gt;, but subject to
modification by a C&lt;$SIG{__DIE__}&gt; handler.  In any case, the C&lt;croak&gt;
function never returns normally.

For historical reasons, if C&lt;pat&gt; is null then the contents of C&lt;ERRSV&gt;
(C&lt;$@&gt;) will be used as an error message or object instead of building an
error message from arguments.  If you want to throw a non-string object,
or build an error message in an SV yourself, it is preferable to use
the L&lt;/croak_sv&gt; function, which does not involve clobbering C&lt;ERRSV&gt;.

	void	croak(const char *pat, ...)

=item croak_no_modify

Exactly equivalent to C&lt;Perl_croak(aTHX_ &quot;%s&quot;, PL_no_modify)&gt;, but generates
terser object code than using C&lt;Perl_croak&gt;.  Less code used on exception code
paths reduces CPU cache pressure.

The following functions have been flagged as part of the public API,
but are currently undocumented.  Use them at your own risk, as the
interfaces are subject to change.  Functions that are not listed in this
document are not intended for public use, and should NOT be used under any
circumstances.

If you feel you need to use one of these functions, first send email to
L&lt;perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org&gt;.  It may be
that there is a good reason for the function not being documented, and it
should be removed from this list; or it may just be that no one has gotten
around to documenting it.  In the latter case, you will be asked to submit a
patch to document the function.  Once your patch is accepted, it will indicate
that the interface is stable (unless it is explicitly marked otherwise) and
usable by you.
