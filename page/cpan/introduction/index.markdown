# Introduction

MetaCPAN has over XXX thousand modules and it can be hard to know which module
is the best one.  For example there are at least XXX modules for dealing XXXX.
New modules appear all the time which make the old best solution obsolete.  It
can be hard to keep up.

This chapter is an attempt to help new users decide quickly which modules to
use.  These recommendations are a biased set of opionions based on my personal
experiences and on the writing of people I respect.

Feedback is wanted!  If any of these recommendations are wrong or outdated or
not nuanced enough please [let me
know](https://github.com/kablamo/mvp.kablamo.org/issues).  Part of the reason
I'm undertaking this is so that the community tells me when I'm using the wrong
module.

Sources (other than experience):

## MSTPAN

My largest source of inspiration is
[mstpan](http://blog.kablamo.org/2015/09/08/mstpan/) from which I've stolen
liberally and shamelessly because its a really good set of blog posts from
2015.  However I wanted that resource to be available in a more discoverable
format that could be maintained via github (like this book).

## Task::Kensho

The Enlighted Perl Organization created
[Task::Kensho](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Kensho) and it was one of the
first attempts at making module recommendations.  

## Belike::Dagolden

[Dave Golden](http://www.dagolden.com/) is the author of a number of widely
used modules which I like and use.  He also keeps a [list of modules he
uses](https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::BeLike::DAGOLDEN).

## Neil Bowers

[Neil Bowers](http://neilb.org) is another developer who has written some [great
module reviews](http://neilb.org/reviews/).  I wish he would write more.

## DiscouragedModules

The use of some libraries is
[discouraged](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Freenode::DiscouragedModules).
