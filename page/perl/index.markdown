# Perl design goals

#### Design goals

Perl's design goals include flexibility, expressiveness, and power. 

> "I realized at that point that there was a huge ecological niche between the
C language and Unix shells. C was good for manipulating complex things  - you
can call it <span class="highlight">'manipulexity.'</span> And the shells were good at whipping up things -
what I call <span class="highlight">'whipupitude.'</span> But there was this big blank area where neither C
nor shell were good, and that's where I aimed Perl." <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Larry Wall, author of Perl


#### Philosophy

Some sayings in the Perl community:

- **TIMTOWDI** - There Is More Than One Way To Do It
- **DWIM** - Do What I Mean (aka The Principle of Least Astonishment)
- **Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible**
