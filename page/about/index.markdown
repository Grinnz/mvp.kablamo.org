# About this book

The primary goal of this book is to make experienced developers coming from
other languages proficient in Perl quickly through concise tutorials that are
about 1 screenful in size.  I literally review each sentence in each
article and try to remove unnecessary words.

Also, I want this book to be an anti-textbook.  Personally I hate textbooks.
I'm in a hurry and in the age of stackoverflow and blogs and info graphics, I
want my information concise and to the point.  I just need to learn that one
thing so I can ship my project.

In order to accomplish this I left out dicussions and edge cases that were
uncommon or not essential.  Instead I've tried to link to more information
where possible. I've also chosen to be opinionated.  Its impossible to keep
things short and present all the available options.

#### Motivation

I wrote this book accidentally during a vacation.  I started typing and
everything just fell out of me.  

This book tries to solve a problem I keep having.  I have been writing Perl
code since 1998 and I love the language.  However, I often run across Perl
developers who are visiting from other languages and I can see they are
frustrated, unhappy, and struggling.  Over the years I've asked them about that
struggle and from my personal experience it seems to come down to roughly 3
things:

1. References
2. Object oriented programming
3. Random stuff they can easily do in their favorite language but don't
yet know how to do in Perl.

The bottom line is they don't know how to quickly find the information they
need.  The information is out there but new Perl developers don't want to spend
hours digging through blogs, old verbose documentation, flipping through
hundreds of pages from various old textbooks.  They want to get some work done
and move on with life.
