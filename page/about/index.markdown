# About this book

The primary goal of this book is to make experienced developers coming from
other languages proficient in Perl quickly through concise tutorials that are
about 1 screenful in size.  Being concise is key goal.  Everyone is in a hurry
and don't want to wade through a lot of unnecessary prose.  I literally review
each sentence in each article and try to remove unnecessary words.

Also, I wanted this book to be an anti-textbook.  Personally I hate textbooks.
I'm in a hurry and in the age of stackoverflow and blogs and info graphics, I
want my information concise and to the point.  I just need to learn that one
thing so I can ship my project.

In order to accomplish this I left out dicussions and edge cases that were
uncommon or not essential.  Instead I've tried to link to more information
where possible. I've also chosen to be opinionated.  Its hard to keep
things short and present all the available options.

#### Motivation

I wrote this book accidentally during a vacation.  I started typing and
everything just fell out of me.  

This book tries to solve a problem I keep having.  I have been writing Perl
code since 1998 and I love the language.  However, I often run across good
developers who are visiting Perl from other languages and having trouble
getting up to speed.  Over the years I've asked them about that struggle and
anecdotally it seems to come down to roughly 3 things:

1. References (actually dereferencing)
2. Object oriented programming
3. Random stuff they can easily do in their favorite language but don't
yet know how to do in Perl (opening files, testing, templates, dependencies,
etc).

There are solutions to all these problems.  But developers who
are new to Perl don't have a single good, up-to-date, easily digestable online
source of information and answers.  The information is out there but few people
want to spend hours digging through blogs, perusing old meandering and
extremely detailed documentation, or flipping through hundreds of pages from
various textbooks.  For many people Perl is just a tool for getting their work
done and they want a concise answer addressing their exact problem and then
they want to use it to get some work done and move on with life.
