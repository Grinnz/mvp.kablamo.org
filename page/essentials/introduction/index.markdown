This chapter is about builtin functions.  Sort of.  

Perl has lots of builtin functions and I wanted to make Chapter 2 all about how
to use them.  However in many situations there are modules on MetaCPAN which
are often a better choice because they have better user interfaces or make it
harder to poke yourself in the eye.  

So while a large part of this chapter is dedicated to the most commonly used
builtins, a significant portion is dedicated to MetaCPAN modules which improve
on that core functionality.

By the way, the official documentation for all Perl builtin functions is available here:

- [Functions A-Z](https://perldoc.perl.org/index-functions.html)
- [Functions by category](https://perldoc.perl.org/index-functions-by-cat.html)
