# Introduction to Perl

> "I realized at that point that there was a huge ecological niche between the
C language and Unix shells. C was good for manipulating complex things  - you
can call it <span class="highlight">'manipulexity.'</span> And the shells were good at whipping up things -
what I call <span class="highlight">'whipupitude.'</span> But there was this big blank area where neither C
nor shell were good, and that's where I aimed Perl." <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Larry Wall, author of Perl

Perl's design goals include flexibility, expressiveness, and power.  Perl is good
at enabling developers to quickly whip up solutions that work.
